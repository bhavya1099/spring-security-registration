Scenario 1: Validate UserDto Class Support

Details:
  TestName: testUserDtoClassSupport
  Description: This test is designed to verify whether the 'supports' method correctly identifies that it can support UserDto class.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Class object representing the UserDto class.
  Act: Invoke the 'supports' method with the UserDto class object as a parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the result of the 'supports' method is true.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that UserDto class is supported. This is expected because the 'supports' method is designed to return true when UserDto class or its subclass is passed as an argument. This test is crucial to ensure that the 'supports' method correctly identifies the classes it can handle.

Scenario 2: Validate Non-support of Different Class

Details:
  TestName: testNonSupportOfDifferentClass
  Description: This test is designed to verify that the 'supports' method correctly identifies that it cannot support classes other than UserDto.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Class object representing a different class (not UserDto or its subclass).
  Act: Invoke the 'supports' method with this different class object as a parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the result of the 'supports' method is false.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that a class that is not UserDto or its subclass is not supported. This is expected because the 'supports' method is designed to return false when a class other than UserDto or its subclass is passed as an argument. This test is crucial to ensure that the 'supports' method correctly identifies the classes it cannot handle.

Scenario 3: Validate Support of UserDto Subclass

Details:
  TestName: testSupportOfUserDtoSubclass
  Description: This test is designed to check if the 'supports' method can correctly identify a subclass of UserDto as being supported.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Class object representing a subclass of UserDto.
  Act: Invoke the 'supports' method with the subclass object as a parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the result of the 'supports' method is true.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that a subclass of UserDto is supported. This is expected because the 'supports' method is designed to return true when UserDto class or its subclass is passed as an argument. This test is important to ensure that the 'supports' method correctly identifies subclasses of UserDto as being supported.
