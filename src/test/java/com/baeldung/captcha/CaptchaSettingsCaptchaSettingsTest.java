ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=CaptchaSettings_fcbfccb416

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Use of Configuration Properties (Spring Framework)
Issue: The code imports ConfigurationProperties from the Spring framework. If configuration properties are not used securely, sensitive information such as database credentials might be exposed.
Solution: Make sure to externalize sensitive configuration properties and encrypt them when necessary. Validate all configuration inputs to prevent injection attacks.

Vulnerability: Excessive public Visibility (CWE-733)
Issue: The class CaptchaSettings is public. If it contains sensitive data, it could be accessed from other classes, potentially breaching the data integrity and confidentiality principles.
Solution: Restrict access to this class if not necessary, and consider using getter and setter methods instead of public fields.

Vulnerability: Empty Constructor (CWE-489)
Issue: The use of an empty constructor might indicate that the object can be instantiated without necessary setup safeguards being in place.
Solution: Ensure the constructor is adequately implemented, securing object's instantiation process.

Vulnerability: Unused or Overly Broad Imports (Java)
Issue: Inappropriately imported libraries can often lead to unnecessary code bloat and potential security vulnerabilities.
Solution: Re-evaluate your library imports. Only import the specific classes you need to use, rather than the entire library or package.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Validate instantiation of CaptchaSettings instance

Details:  
  TestName: validateCaptchaSettingsInstanceCreation.
  Description: This test will validate the creation of an instance of the CaptchaSettings. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare to create an instance of CaptchaSettings. 
  Act: Instantiate a new CaptchaSettings object. 
  Assert: Assert that the CaptchaSettings instance is not null.
Validation: 
  The assertion will verify that a CaptchaSettings instance is created successfully. The significance lies in confirming successful object instantiation in the context of the application behavior.

Scenario 2: Verify the Default Constructor

Details:  
  TestName: verifyDefaultConstructor.
  Description: This test will check if the default constructor for CaptchaSettings is behaving as expected.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement is necessary as we are testing the default constructor. 
  Act: Call the default constructor to create an instance of CaptchaSettings.
  Assert: Assert that the CaptchaSettings object is not null.
Validation: 
  The assertion will confirm that the default constructor is functional and it is creating a new instance of CaptchaSettings. 

Scenario 3: Check if default settings are populated

Details:  
  TestName: checkIfDefaultSettingsArePopulate.
  Description: This test will execute the default constructor and verify if it populates any default values, in case the CaptchaSettings class has any predefined default settings in its body.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the expected default settings if they exist. 
  Act: Call the constructor to create an instance of CaptchaSettings.
  Assert: Compare the actual instance settings with expected default settings.
Validation: 
  This test will validate if the default constructor populates any default settings, giving insights into the severity if these settings are altered in the application's lifecycle.
