================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data
Issue: Java applications that deserialize untrusted data can be vulnerable to arbitrary code execution attacks.
Solution: Do not deserialize data from untrusted sources. Use safe alternatives like JSON or XML parsers, with strong type checking.

Vulnerability: CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input
Issue: If user-supplied data is included in SQL queries without neutralization, a successful SQL Injection attack can occur.
Solution: Use prepared statements with variable binding (parameterized queries) instead of building SQL queries using string concatenation.

Vulnerability: CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers (HTTP Response Splitting)
Issue: If the application does not properly sanitize input, an attacker can manipulate the HTTP headers and control the application's responses.
Solution: Use functions provided by the framework to set HTTP headers. Never use user input in the header values.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Default Constructor Test

Details:  
  TestName: verifyDefaultConstructorCaptchaSettings.
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the default constructor within the "CaptchaSettings" class. It aims to determine if an empty instance of the class can be created without any exceptions being thrown.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement is required as we are testing a default constructor.
  Act: A new instance of "CaptchaSettings" class is created by calling the default constructor.
  Assert: Assert that the new instance of "CaptchaSettings" is not null.
Validation: 
  The validation aims to verify the initialization of the CaptchaSettings object. The expected result is true because the constructor is designed to create an empty instance of the class. Having this test is important to ensure the basic instantiation of this class is working as designed.

Scenario 2: Null properties Test

Details:  
  TestName: verifyNullPropertiesInCaptchaSettings.
  Description: This test is meant to verify the values of all properties within an instance of "CaptchaSettings" when created with the default constructor. It checks if all properties are initialized to null rather than garbage values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new instance of "CaptchaSettings" class using the default constructor.
  Act: Get each property's value from the created instance.
  Assert: Assert that all properties returned a null value.
Validation: 
  The validation will verify that all properties of a newly created instance of the CaptchaSettings class have null values. This is expected as we're using the default constructor which does not assign values to any properties. This ensures that properties are not holding any undefined or garbage values upon object initialization.

Scenario 3: Test Object Equality

Details:  
  TestName: verifyObjectEqualityInCaptchaSettings.
  Description: This test is meant to check whether two objects of "CaptchaSettings" class created using the default constructor are equal.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two distinct instances of "CaptchaSettings" class using the default constructor.
  Act: Check if these two objects are equal.
  Assert: Assert that the two objects are not the same.
Validation: 
  The validation will confirm that two separately created objects of CaptchaSettings class are recognized as different objects, despite being created with the same default constructor. This ensures that distinct objects are not mistakenly recognized as the same because of identical property values (which are all null upon initialization).
