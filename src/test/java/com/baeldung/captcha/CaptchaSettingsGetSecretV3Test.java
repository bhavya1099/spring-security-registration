================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure storage of sensitive configuration
Issue: Sensitive application configuration data, such as secret keys, API keys, could be exposed if the configuration properties file is not protected properly. It can lead to data leaks or unauthorized access.
Solution: Store sensitive configuration data in secure vaults or use environment variables, ensuring that they are not hard-coded and not committed into version control. Additionally, restrict access to the properties file.

Vulnerability: Insecure use of getter methods
Issue: Getter methods could expose private data if not handled properly. It can lead to information disclosure and can be taken advantage of by malicious entities.
Solution: Always ensure that data returned by getter methods does not contain sensitive information. Getter methods can be controlled using access modifiers wherever necessary.

Scenario 1: Test getSecretV3() method returns proper value

Details:  
  TestName: testGetSecretRETURNSCorrectValue
  Description: This test is meant to check the correct functionality of the getSecretV3() method. It should return the exact value stored in the variable secretV3. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Not required as there is no preliminary setup for this test. The state of the secretV3 variable determines the outcome of the test.
  Act: Invoke getSecretV3() method.
  Assert: Use assertEquals() method to compare the actual value returned by getSecretV3() with the expected value.
Validation: 
  Validate that the returned value matches the expected value and the method retrieves the correct value that present in secretV3. The significance of this test is to ensure that the getSecretV3() method has no side effects and all the properties are correctly retrieved from the variable.

Scenario 2: Test getSecretV3() method returns null value

Details:
  TestName: testGetSecretRETURNSNullValue
  Description: This test is meant to check whether the getSecretV3() method is returning null value properly when no value is stored in the secretV3 variable.
Execution:
  Arrange: Not required as no preliminary setup is required. If a value is not assigned to the secretV3 variable, it should return null by default.
  Act: Invoke getSecretV3() method.
  Assert: Use assertNull() method to check the returned value from getSecretV3() method.
Validation: 
  Validate that the method returns null when there is no value in secretV3 variable. It is crucial to verify that the getSecretV3() work correctly even when the variable is empty.

Scenario 3: Test getSecretV3() method in a multi-threaded environment

Details:
  TestName: testGetSecretInMultiThreadedEnvironment
  Description: This test is meant to verify that the getSecretV3() method works properly in a multi-threaded environment and returns the correct value of variable secretV3.
Execution:
  Arrange: Simulate a multi-threaded environment.
  Act: Invoke getSecretV3() method concurrently from multiple threads.
  Assert: Use assertEquals() to compare the actual value returned by getSecretV3() from each thread with the expected value.
Validation: 
  Validate that the method behaves correctly and returns a correct value even when invoked concurrently from multiple threads. This test is significant for verifying thread-safety of the method.
