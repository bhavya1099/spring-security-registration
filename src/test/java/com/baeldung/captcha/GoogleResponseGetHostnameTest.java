================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-89: Improvement for SQL Queries
Issue: If performing SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterized queries, code can potentially be exposed to SQL injection attacks.
Solution: Ensure all SQL queries use prepared statements or parameterized queries, and avoid direct concatenation of user inputs in queries.

Vulnerability: CWE-22: Path traversal vulnerability with file operations
Issue: File operations without adequate path sanitization can lead to path traversal vulnerabilities, leading to attackers being able to retrieve, corrupt, or delete sensitive data.
Solution: Avoid direct use of user inputs in filesystem paths. If it's unavoidable, validate and sanitize these inputs properly.

Vulnerability: CWE-79: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Issue: If user inputs are being directly rendered to the end users without any sanitization / escaping, it can lead to Cross-Site Scripting where attackers can inject malicious scripts.
Solution: Properly sanitize or escape all user data that is being rendered to the browser.

"""
Scenario 1: Get Hostname Successfully
Details:
    TestName: testGetHostnameSuccessfully
    Description: The test is meant to check the normal and successful operation of the getHostname method. We assume that the hostname property has been set correctly, and we examine how the method retrieves this value.
Execution:
    Arrange: Assign a known value to the hostname property.
    Act: Invoke the getHostname method without any parameters.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned value is equal to the value assigned to the hostname property.
Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that getHostname method returns the correct hostname. The expected result is achieved when the assigned value and the retrieved hostname match. This test validates that the method behaves as expected under standard operating conditions.

Scenario 2: Get Null Hostname
Details:
    TestName: testGetNullHostname
    Description: This test checks how the getHostname method behaves when the hostname has not been set or assigned a null value. The purpose is to ensure that the method can handle null values gracefully.
Execution:
    Arrange: Assign null to the hostname property.
    Act: Invoke the getHostname method without any parameters.
    Assert: Assert that the returned value is null.
Validation:
    The assertion attempts to confirm the method's handling of null hostname values. The expected result is a null return value. This test validates how the method handles situations when the hostname property is not set.

Scenario 3: Hostname after alteration
Details:
    TestName: testGetHostnameAfterAlteration
    Description: This test checks whether the getHostname method retrieves the most recent assignment to the hostname property. The method is expected to always return the current hostname value even if it has been adjusted multiple times.
Execution:
    Arrange: Assign different values to the hostname property in a series of operations.
    Act: Invoke the getHostname method without any parameters.
    Assert: Assert that the returned value is equal to the final value assigned to the hostname property.
Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that getHostname method returns the most recent value of hostname. This test ensures that the method reflects the mutable nature of the hostname property.
