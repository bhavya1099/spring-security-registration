================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-209: Information Exposure Through an Error Message
Issue: The application might disclose sensitive information through the error messages. This might aid an attacker in designing a successful attack.
Solution: It's recommended to handle exceptions in a generic way that doesn't reveal system-specific details. For example, instead of 'Client exceeded maximum number of failed attempts', use a generic message like 'Invalid ReCaptcha response'.

Vulnerability: CWE-779: Logging of Excessive Data
Issue: Sensitive information might be logged via LOGGER.debug(). This can potentially expose sensitive data to unauthorized entities having access to logs.
Solution: Ensure that sensitive information is not recorded in logs. Be especially careful when logging debug information, and consider using log levels to control the information being logged.

Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The application might not validate or improperly validate the 'response' input that can alter control flow or data flow in a predictable way.
Solution: Implement strong input validation. Besides sanity checks, the application should validate all input data for length, type, syntax, and business rules before using the data in any processing instruction.

================================================================================
""" 
Scenario 1: Successful Security Check 

Details:  
  TestName: successfulSecurityCheck
  Description: This test attempts to validate a normal functioning of the 'securityCheck' method, ensuring that no exceptions are thrown if the ReCaptchaAttemptService does not block the client IP and the response sanity check returns true. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the 'reCaptchaAttemptService' to return false for the 'isBlocked' method, and the responseSanityCheck to return true.
  Act: Call the 'securityCheck' method with a valid IP and response.
  Assert: None. (As the method does not return anything, but we are checking for the absence of an exception)
Validation: 
  Here we are validating the function under normal conditions. If the test runs without throwing any exceptions, it is assumed to have passed.

Scenario 2: Client IP Blocked

Details:  
  TestName: clientIpBlocked
  Description: This test checks the scenario where the client's IP has been blocked by the ReCaptchaAttemptService.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the 'reCaptchaAttemptService' to return true for the 'isBlocked' method.
  Act: Call the 'securityCheck' method with a blocked IP.
  Assert: Assert that a ReCaptchaInvalidException is thrown with the message "Client exceeded maximum number of failed attempts".
Validation: 
  This test ensures the system is able to seamlessly handle a blocked client IP by correctly throwing an exception with the appropriate message.

Scenario 3: Response Contains Invalid Characters

Details:  
  TestName: responseWithInvalidCharacters
  Description: This test checks how the 'securityCheck' method behaves when it receives a response that contains invalid characters.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock 'responseSanityCheck' to return false.
  Act: Call the 'securityCheck' method with a response containing invalid characters.
  Assert: Assert that a ReCaptchaInvalidException is thrown with the message "Response contains invalid characters".
Validation: 
  Through this test, we are ensuring that the system is able to appropriately handle responses with invalid characters by throwing an exception with the correct message.
 
Scenario 4: Null Response Parameter

Details:  
  TestName: nullResponseParameter
  Description: Aim of this test is to check the behavior of 'securityCheck' method when passed a null response.
Execution:
  Arrange: None.
  Act: Call the 'securityCheck' method with a null response.
  Assert: None. (As the method does not take any action if the response is null)
Validation: 
  Through this test, we validate the behavior of the code when a null response is passed. We do not anticipate any exceptions to be thrown in such a scenario.
