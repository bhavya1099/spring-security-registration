================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-209: Information Exposure Through an Error Message
Issue: The application throws detailed error messages such as 'Client exceeded maximum number of failed attempts' and 'Response contains invalid characters'. These messages could provide an attacker with useful information about the system.
Solution: Consider using more generic error messages that do not reveal system-specific details.

Vulnerability: CWE-384: Session Fixation
Issue: The application does not appear to manage sessions or invalidate old sessions. This could allow an attacker to hijack a user's session.
Solution: Implement proper session management. Invalidate old sessions and issue new session IDs whenever there is a change in the authentication state.

Vulnerability: CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
Issue: The application does not appear to have any CSRF protections in place. An attacker could trick a user into making an authenticated request to the server.
Solution: Use anti-CSRF tokens and check the referer header of incoming requests to ensure they originated from the correct location.

Vulnerability: CWE-601: URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')
Issue: The application does not appear to validate URLs before redirecting. This could allow an attacker to redirect users to an arbitrary site.
Solution: Ensure that all URLs are validated before redirection. Do not allow redirection to arbitrary URLs.

Scenario 1: Validate security check with a valid response and IP
Details:  
  TestName: testSecurityWithValidResponseAndIP
  Description: This test is meant to check if the securityCheck method works correctly with a valid response and IP that has not been blocked.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the reCaptchaAttemptService to return false for isBlocked() method and true for responseSanityCheck().
    Act: Invoke securityCheck() method with a valid response.
    Assert: No exception should be thrown.
  Validation: 
    This test verifies that the securityCheck works as expected for valid inputs. If the IP is not blocked and the response is valid, no exception should be thrown.

Scenario 2: Validate security check with a blocked IP
Details:  
  TestName: testSecurityWithBlockedIP
  Description: This test is meant to check if the securityCheck method throws an exception when the client IP is blocked.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the reCaptchaAttemptService to return true for isBlocked() method.
    Act: Invoke securityCheck() method with any response.
    Assert: A ReCaptchaInvalidException should be thrown with the message "Client exceeded maximum number of failed attempts".
  Validation: 
    This test verifies that the securityCheck correctly identifies blocked IPs and throws an exception.

Scenario 3: Validate security check with an invalid response
Details:  
  TestName: testSecurityWithInvalidResponse
  Description: This test is meant to check if the securityCheck method throws an exception when the response contains invalid characters.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the reCaptchaAttemptService to return false for isBlocked() method and false for responseSanityCheck().
    Act: Invoke securityCheck() method with an invalid response.
    Assert: A ReCaptchaInvalidException should be thrown with the message "Response contains invalid characters".
  Validation: 
    This test verifies that the securityCheck correctly identifies invalid responses and throws an exception.

Scenario 4: Validate security check with a null response
Details:  
  TestName: testSecurityWithNullResponse
  Description: This test is meant to check if the securityCheck method works correctly when the response is null.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the reCaptchaAttemptService to return false for isBlocked() method.
    Act: Invoke securityCheck() method with a null response.
    Assert: A ReCaptchaInvalidException should be thrown with the message "Response contains invalid characters".
  Validation: 
    This test verifies that the securityCheck treats null responses as invalid and throws an exception.
