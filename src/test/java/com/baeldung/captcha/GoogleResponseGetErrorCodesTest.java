================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Injection flaws (CWE-74)
Issue: If the `ErrorCode` objects are populated with user-controlled data (not shown in the snippet), injection flaws can occur.
Solution: Always validate user inputs before consuming in your programming logic. Sanitize user inputs for SQL, HTML, JavaScript, and system commands to prevent injection attacks.

Vulnerability: Insecure Deserialization (CWE-502)
Issue: The use of Jackson library for JSON processing could lead to insecure deserialization, if not properly handled.
Solution: Implement type checks during deserialization and do not blindly accept serialized objects from untrusted sources. Prefer simpler data formats such as JSON and avoid custom serialization methods.

Vulnerability: Insecure Use of Cryptography (CWE-327)
Issue: The code does not show any signs of using encryption, if sensitive information such as error details are being handled, encryption should be considered
Solution: Apply the correct use of cryptography to protect sensitive information being stored or transmitted. Always use up-to-date, strong cryptographic standards to protect sensitive data.

 Scenario 1: Successful Retrieval of Error Codes

  Details:  
    TestName: testSuccessfulRetrievalOfErrorCodes
    Description: This test is meant to check if the method getErrorCodes accurately and successfully retrieves the array of error codes within the system. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize with a set of error codes.
    Act: Invoke the getErrorCodes method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to validate that the returned array matches the initialized set of error codes.
  Validation: 
    This assertion checks whether the returned array is exactly as the initialized error codes; thus verifying the successful retrieval of error codes within the system.
    This test is significant because if error codes cannot be accurately fetched, it can lead to inaccurate handling and logging of errors within the application.

  Scenario 2: Retrieval of Error Codes When None Exist

  Details:  
    TestName: testRetrievalOfErrorCodesWhenNoneExist
    Description: This test checks if the method getErrorCodes handles situations where there are no error codes within the system. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: No setup is required as no error codes are preset.
    Act: Invoke the getErrorCodes method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to confirm that the returned array is indeed empty or null.
  Validation: 
    This assertion checks that an empty or null array is returned when there are no error codes set within the system, verifying the method's correct functionality in the absence of error codes.
    This scenario is important to test to ensure that the method handles different states of the system correctly and doesn't cause an application crash or inappropriate behavior when no error codes are set.

  Scenario 3: Validate the Length of Returned ErrorCodes Array

  Details:  
    TestName: testValidateLengthOfReturnedErrorCodeArray
    Description: This test is to ensure the length of the returned array of error codes is accurate. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize with a known quantity of error codes.
    Act: Invoke the getErrorCodes method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to confirm the size of the returned array matches the size of the initialized error codes.
  Validation: 
    This assertion verifies that the system accurately returns all error codes present in the system by comparing the lengths. 
    This test is significant in ensuring the method is comprehensive in its retrieval of error codes. Losing track of error codes can impact error handling or reporting.
