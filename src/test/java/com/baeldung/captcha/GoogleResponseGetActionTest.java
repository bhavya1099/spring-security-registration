================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-209: Information Exposure Through an Error Message
Issue: The method getAction() returns action which may contain sensitive information. If an exception occurs and the error message includes this information, it may be exposed to users or attackers.
Solution: Avoid including sensitive information in error messages. Use logging mechanisms for debugging and troubleshooting.

Vulnerability: CWE-470: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type
Issue: The import statement includes java.util.Arrays and java.util.HashMap, which could be used to manipulate files. If the application allows unrestricted file upload, it could lead to execution of malicious code.
Solution: Enforce restrictions on the types of files that can be uploaded and use a whitelist of allowed file types. Also, do not rely solely on file extensions to determine the file type.

Vulnerability: CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption
Issue: The java.util.HashMap can lead to high memory consumption if not properly managed, which could result in a Denial of Service (DoS) if an attacker can influence the size of the HashMap.
Solution: Limit the size of the HashMap and validate the input that affects the size of the HashMap.

"""
Scenario 1: Test to check if getAction returns the correct action string

Details:  
  TestName: testGetActionReturnsCorrectString
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getAction method returns the correct action string that has been set. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a valid action string. 
  Act: Invoke the getAction method. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned action string against the expected string.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the getAction method returns the correct action string. The expected result is based on the action string that was set. This test is significant in ensuring that the action string is correctly retrieved.

Scenario 2: Test to check if getAction returns null when no action is set

Details:  
  TestName: testGetActionReturnsNullWhenNoActionSet
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getAction method returns null when no action string has been set. 
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement is needed for this test as no action string is set. 
  Act: Invoke the getAction method. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the returned action string is null.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the getAction method returns null when no action string is set. This test is significant in ensuring that the method handles cases where no action string is set.

Scenario 3: Test to check if getAction returns empty string when an empty action is set

Details:  
  TestName: testGetActionReturnsEmptyStringWhenEmptyActionSet
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getAction method returns an empty string when an empty action string has been set. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up an empty action string. 
  Act: Invoke the getAction method. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the returned action string is an empty string.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the getAction method returns an empty string when an empty action string is set. This test is significant in ensuring that the method handles cases where an empty action string is set.
