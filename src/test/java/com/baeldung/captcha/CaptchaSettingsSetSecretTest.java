================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials
Issue: The 'setSecret' function suggests that a secret key or password is potentially being hardcoded somewhere in the application, which can be a severe issue if it is a production environment. If the source code is exposed or available, attackers can get access to these secrets and compromise the system.
Solution: Never hard code sensitive information. Use environment variables or secure vault systems to store and retrieve secrets. You can also use Spring's @Value annotation to fetch secrets from property files which could be secure.

Vulnerability: CWE-498: Cloneable Class Containing Sensitive Information
Issue: This 'setSecret' method is public can potentially be invoked from any class which has access to the instance of this class. This can expose the sensitive data to an unintended class or method and can be a security flaw. It may also create multiple copies of the sensitive information into the memory.
Solution: Ensure secure design by making the method/package-private if it's only intended to be used within the package. Alternatively, use proper defensive copying to prevent unwanted memory leaks.

"""
  Scenario 1: Test to check if the setSecret method correctly assigns the provided string to the 'secret' instance variable.
  Details:  
    TestName: setSecretWithValidStringInput.
    Description: The test checks whether the provided string is correctly set as the instance variable 'secret' by using the method setSecret().
  Execution:
    Arrange: Provide a string input for the setSecret() method.
    Act: Invoke the method setSecret() with the provided string.
    Assert: Compare the provided string and the instance variable 'secret' to check if they are equal.
  Validation: 
    This validation ensures that the setSecret() method correctly assigns the given string to the instance variable 'secret'. This is important for maintaining the secrecy factor in the application.


  Scenario 2: Test to check if the setSecret method assigns null to the 'secret' instance variable when provided with null as input.
  Details:  
    TestName: setSecretWithNullInput.
    Description: The test checks how the setSecret() method acts when provided with null as input.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Provide null input for the setSecret() method.
    Act: Invoke the setSecret() with null.
    Assert: Check if the instance variable 'secret' is set to null.
  Validation: 
    This test is crucial in validating whether the setSecret() method can handle null inputs or if it throws a NullPointerException. This is vital for safeguarding against potential issues with null references in the application.

    
  Scenario 3: Test to validate how the setSecret method acts when it is provided with an empty string as input.
  Details:  
    TestName: setSecretWithEmptyString.
    Description: This test is to check whether an empty string can be set as 'secret' using setSecret() method.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Provide an empty string input for the setSecret() method.
    Act: Invoke setSecret() with an empty string.
    Assert: Check if the instance variable 'secret' remains blank or empty.
  Validation: 
    This validation is essential to ascertain that even the absence of secret(password, key, etc.) does not crash the application and the setSecret() method behaves as expected in such scenarios.
