================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials
Issue: The method 'setSecret' appears to be setting a hardcoded secret key. If this code is shipping to production with hardcoded credentials, this would leave the application open for an attacker to find and exploit the disclosed credentials.
Solution: Don't hardcode credentials in your code. Implement an external solution for secret management, such as an environment variable or a dedicated secrets manager. For instance, in a Spring Boot application, you could use externalized configuration or a secrets manager solution.

Vulnerability: CWE-749: Exposed Dangerous Method or Function
Issue: 'setSecret' method can be a security risk if it is publicly accessible, potentially allowing unauthorized parties to change application secret key.
Solution: Ensure restricted access to sensitive methods. Modify visibility of the method and ensure proper use of Java access modifiers. Access to these types of methods should only be granted to trusted classes or users.

  Scenario 1: Test to verify setSecret when secret is null

  Details:  
    TestName: testSetSecretWhenSecretIsNull
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the `setSecret` method when the input `secret` is null. 

  Execution:
    Arrange: No data to be arranged as the input `secret` is null.
    Act: Invoke the `setSecret` method with null as the parameter.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual value of `secret` after the method call against null.

  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the `secret` variable has been updated to null after the `setSecret` method call. The expected result is null as the input for the method is null. This test is significant as it validates the method's behavior with null inputs. 
  
  ------------------------------------------------------------
  
  Scenario 2: Test to verify setSecret when secret is an empty string 

  Details:  
    TestName: testSetSecretWhenSecretIsEmptyString
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the `setSecret` method when the input `secret` is an empty string. 

  Execution:
    Arrange: No data to be arranged as the input `secret` is "".
    Act: Invoke the `setSecret` method with an empty string as the parameter.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual value of `secret` after the method call against an empty string.

  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the `secret` variable has been updated to an empty string after the `setSecret` method call. The expected result is an empty string as the input for the method is "". This test is important as it verifies the method's behavior with empty string inputs.

  ------------------------------------------------------------
  
  Scenario 3: Test to verify setSecret when secret is a valid string 

  Details:  
    TestName: testSetSecretWhenSecretIsValid
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the `setSecret` method when the input `secret` is a valid string. 

  Execution:
    Arrange: Set the input `secret` as "ValidSecret".
    Act: Invoke the `setSecret` method with "ValidSecret" as the parameter.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual value of `secret` after the method call against "ValidSecret".

  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the `secret` variable has been updated to "ValidSecret" after the `setSecret` method call. The expected result is "ValidSecret" as the input for the method was "ValidSecret". This test is significant as it validates the correct behavior of the method with valid inputs.
