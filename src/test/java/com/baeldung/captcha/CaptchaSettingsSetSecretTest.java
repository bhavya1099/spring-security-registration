================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials
Issue: The method setSecret() suggests that a secret value (perhaps a password or key) is being set directly in the code. If this secret is hard-coded in the application, it can potentially be exposed to attackers, especially if the codebase is not properly secured.
Solution: Avoid hard-coding secrets in your application code. Instead, consider using secure methods of storing secrets such as environment variables, or secret management systems such as HashiCorp's Vault or AWS Secrets Manager.

Vulnerability: CWE-359: Exposure of Private Information ('Privacy Violation')
Issue: If the secret is sensitive user information and the method setSecret() is not properly secured, it may lead to exposure of private information.
Solution: Ensure that any method handling sensitive data is properly secured, and that data is encrypted at rest and in transit. Consider using Java's built-in security features or trusted encryption libraries to encrypt sensitive data.

"""
  Scenario 1: Test for Setting a Valid Secret

  Details:  
    TestName: testSettingValidSecret.
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the setSecret method when a valid secret string is provided. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a valid secret string.
    Act: Invoke the setSecret method with the valid secret string.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual secret with the expected secret.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the setSecret method correctly sets the secret when provided with a valid string. The expected result is that the actual secret matches the expected secret. This test is significant as it verifies the basic functionality of the setSecret method.

  Scenario 2: Test for Setting an Empty Secret

  Details:  
    TestName: testSettingEmptySecret.
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the setSecret method when an empty string is provided. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an empty secret string.
    Act: Invoke the setSecret method with the empty secret string.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual secret with the expected secret.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the setSecret method correctly sets the secret when provided with an empty string. The expected result is that the actual secret matches the expected secret. This test is significant as it checks the method's handling of empty strings.

  Scenario 3: Test for Setting a Null Secret

  Details:  
    TestName: testSettingNullSecret.
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the setSecret method when null is provided. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set the secret string as null.
    Act: Invoke the setSecret method with the null secret string.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual secret with the expected secret.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the setSecret method correctly sets the secret when provided with null. The expected result is that the actual secret matches the expected secret. This test is significant as it checks the method's handling of null values.

  Scenario 4: Test for Setting a Secret with Special Characters

  Details:  
    TestName: testSettingSecretWithSpecialCharacters.
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the setSecret method when a string with special characters is provided. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a secret string with special characters.
    Act: Invoke the setSecret method with the secret string with special characters.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual secret with the expected secret.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the setSecret method correctly sets the secret when provided with a string containing special characters. The expected result is that the actual secret matches the expected secret. This test is significant as it checks the method's handling of strings with special characters.
