================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) or CWE-639
Issue: The method setScore() manipulates an object property without any validation or sanitization checks in place. This could potentially allow for object properties to be manipulated inappropriately if an attacker can control the input.
Solution: Implement appropriate data validation and sanitization measures to ensure only valid inputs are accepted and processed. Set boundaries on the expected score value to prevent user-controlled data modification.

Vulnerability: Uncontrolled format string or CWE-134
Issue: The Jackson Json library is imported which is known to have issues when handling improperly formatted strings or when dealing with arbitrary user-controlled input without proper validation which may lead to remote code execution.
Solution: Always validate the format of the string before passing it to methods that would process them. You must also ensure to run the latest version of the Jackson library with all security patches applied.

Vulnerability: Exposure of Private Information ('Privacy Violation') or CWE-200
Issue: Sensitive information can be exposed through objects or their properties directly to users without proper access control mechanisms in place.
Solution: Implement appropriate access control checks to ensure that only authorized users can access and manipulate specific object properties.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Validate that setScore correctly sets the score value

Details:  
  TestName: setScoreSuccessfullySetsValue
  Description: This test is meant to check whether the setScore method correctly sets the score value as expected. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the class and initialize a score value.
  Act: Invoke the setScore method with the initialized score value as the parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the value assigned to the score field by the method against the initial score value.
Validation: 
  This aims to verify that the setScore method successfully sets the score field value. The expected result is that the set score should be equal to the assigned score. The significance of this test is to ensure that the score can be accurately assigned which crucial to the application's behavior.

Scenario 2: Validate that setScore handles negative values as expected

Details:  
  TestName: setScoreHandlesNegativeValues
  Description: This test checks how the setScore method handles negative values. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the class and initialize a score value as a negative number.
  Act: Invoke the setScore method with the initialized score value as the parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to confirm whether the score value is indeed negative.
Validation: 
  The goal is to verify how the method handles when a negative value is passed as the score. Based on your business logic, you could alter this test to ensure that the value does not become negative or that it throws an expected exception. 

Scenario 3: Validate that setScore handles zero value as expected

Details:  
  TestName: setScoreHandlesZeroValue
  Description: This scenario checks whether zero is accepted as a valid input for the setScore method. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the class and set score value as zero.
  Act: Invoke the setScore method with the score value as the parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to confirm whether the score value is indeed zero.
Validation: 
  The aim is to verify whether the method correctly sets and retains zero as the score value. This test case is significant because zero is a boundary value and often has a different effect or output which needs to be confirmed.

Scenario 4: Validate extreme large score value

Details:  
  TestName: setScoreHandlesLargeValue
  Description: This test is designed to verify how the setScore method handles extremely large score values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the class and initialize a very large score value.
  Act: Invoke the setScore method with the large score value as a parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the assigned score against the very large score value.
Validation: 
  The test aims to validate the functionality and robustness of the setScore method when handling extreme values. The expected outcome should be that the method either successfully assigns the score value or throws an appropriate exception.
