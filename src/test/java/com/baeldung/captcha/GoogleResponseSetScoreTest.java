================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: Without proper input validation, an attacker could manipulate the 'score' variable to unexpected values, which can lead to potential security risks.
Solution: Implement rigorous input validation checks before setting the value of 'score'.

Vulnerability: CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values
Issue: If the 'score' is used in security-critical contexts such as cryptography, usage of predictable values can lead to potential security risks.
Solution: Ensure use of a cryptographically secure random number generator when random values are required for security-critical operations.

Vulnerability: CWE-359: Exposure of Private Information ('Privacy Violation')
Issue: If the 'score' variable contains sensitive information, its exposure can lead to privacy violations.
Solution: Ensure that sensitive information is properly protected and not exposed unnecessarily. Use proper access control mechanisms.

Vulnerability: CWE-489: Leftover Debug Code
Issue: If the code snippet is part of debug code, it can lead to exposure of sensitive information.
Solution: Make sure to remove any debug code or make it inactive before deploying the application.

""" 
  Scenario 1: Test to check if the method sets a positive score correctly

  Details:  
    TestName: testSetPositiveScore.
    Description: This test checks if the method setScore correctly sets a positive score value. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize a positive float value. 
    Act: Invoke the setScore method with the initialized float value as parameter. 
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if score is equal to the initialized value.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the setScore method correctly sets the score when a positive float value is provided as parameter. This is crucial for the correct operation of the application.

  Scenario 2: Test to check if the method sets a zero score correctly

  Details:  
    TestName: testSetZeroScore.
    Description: This test checks if the method setScore correctly sets a score value of zero. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize a float value of zero. 
    Act: Invoke the setScore method with the initialized float value as parameter. 
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if score is equal to the initialized value.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the setScore method correctly sets the score when a float value of zero is provided as parameter. This is important as zero is a valid score and the application should handle it correctly.

  Scenario 3: Test to check if the method sets a negative score correctly

  Details:  
    TestName: testSetNegativeScore.
    Description: This test checks if the method setScore correctly sets a negative score value. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize a negative float value. 
    Act: Invoke the setScore method with the initialized float value as parameter. 
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if score is equal to the initialized value.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the setScore method correctly sets the score when a negative float value is provided as parameter. This is important as negative scores might be used to indicate penalties or deductions in some contexts.
