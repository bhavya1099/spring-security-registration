"""
  Scenario 1: Test to verify the change in success value from false to true

  Details:  
    TestName: testChangeInSuccessValue.
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the 'setSuccess' method. The test will verify if the method properly changes success's value from false to true. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize the success variable as false. 
    Act: Invoke the 'setSuccess' method with the parameter as 'true'.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the success value has been changed to true. 
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify the expected result - successful change in the 'success' variable's value. This test ensures that the 'setSuccess' method behaves as expected and changes the 'success' variable's value correctly. 

  Scenario 2: Test to verify the change in success value from true to false

  Details:  
    TestName: testChangeInSuccessValueToFalse.
    Description: The test is meant to check the functionality of the 'setSuccess' method in an opposite scenario where we try to change the success variable's value from true to false. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize the success variable as true. 
    Act: Invoke the 'setSuccess' method with the parameter as 'false'. 
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the success value has been changed to false. 
  Validation: 
    This assertion verifies the expected result - successful change in the 'success' value to false. This test ensures the 'setSuccess' behavior under a difference scenario leading to a different expected result. 

  Scenario 3: Test with null variable setup and using the setSuccess to initialize the success variable

  Details:  
    TestName: testInitializationOfSuccess. 
    Description: The test checks if the 'setSuccess' method can initialize the 'success' variable through the argument it receives. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Don't initialize the success variable. Leave it as null.
    Act: Invoke the 'setSuccess' with the parameter true or false.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the success has been initialized to the parameter value. 
  Validation: 
    This assertion verifies if the 'setSuccess' method can not only change the value of 'success' variable but also initialize it. It ensures the proper functioning of 'setSuccess' method even with uninitialized variables.
