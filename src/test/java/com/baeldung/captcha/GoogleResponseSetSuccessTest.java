================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Unsecure Data Transmission (CWE-319)
Issue: If the application using this method transmits JSON output over HTTP without encryption, the data could be read by an unauthorized party.
Solution: Use HTTPS instead of HTTP to ensure the security of data transmission. Apply end-to-end encryption to the data transmission layer.

"""
Scenario 1: Validate setSuccess Method with True Value 

  Details:  
    TestName: shouldSetSuccessToTrue.
    Description: This test checks the setSuccess() method for correct functionality when it's passed a 'true' boolean value. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: There is no required setup as the method does not rely on any prerequisites.
    Act: Invoke the setSuccess method and pass in 'true' as the argument.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the success field of the object has been set to 'true'.
  Validation: 
    The test validates that the setSuccess method correctly sets the success field to 'true'. 
    This is vital for ensuring that the success status of an operation can be accurately tracked.

Scenario 2: Validate setSuccess Method with False Value 

  Details:  
    TestName: shouldSetSuccessToFalse.
    Description: This test checks the setSuccess() method for correct functionality when it's passed a 'false' boolean value. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: There is no required setup as the method does not rely on any prerequisites.
    Act: Invoke the setSuccess method and pass in 'false' as the argument.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the success field of the object has been set to 'false'.
  Validation: 
    The test validates that the setSuccess method correctly sets the success field to 'false'. 
    This impacts whether a successful or unsuccessful operation status is propagated through the application.

Scenario 3: Validate setSuccess Method Does Not Affect Other Fields 

  Details:  
    TestName: shouldNotAffectOtherFields.
    Description: This test checks that the setSuccess() method does not inadvertently modify any other fields in the object. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize other fields in the object with predetermined values.
    Act: Invoke the setSuccess() method with either a 'true' or 'false' argument.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the other fields in the object have not changed.
  Validation: 
    The test confirms that the setSuccess method only affects the success field and does not inadvertently modify other fields. 
    This ensures the consistency and integrity of other data within the application.
