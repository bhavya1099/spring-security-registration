================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The setter method does not perform any validation on the input. This can lead to injection attacks or other unexpected behavior.
Solution: Apply input validation in the setter method to ensure that only valid data is accepted.

Vulnerability: CWE-359: Exposure of Private Information ('Privacy Violation')
Issue: The setter method is public, which allows any class to modify the challengeTimeStamp. This could lead to a privacy violation if sensitive data is being stored.
Solution: Limit the accessibility of your methods and data as much as possible. Consider making the setter method protected or package-private, or consider using a more secure method of data storage.

Vulnerability: CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values
Issue: If the 'challengeTimeStamp' is used for security controls, such as session identifiers or cryptographic keys, it needs to be truly random. Using time-based values could lead to predictability and reduced security.
Solution: Use a secure method of generating random values, such as java.security.SecureRandom, when creating security controls.

"""
Scenario 1: Valid Timestamp Input Test

Details:
  TestName: testValidTimestampInput
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method correctly sets the challengeTimeStamp when a valid timestamp string is passed as an argument.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a string with a valid timestamp.
  Act: Invoke the setChallengeTimeStamp method with the created string.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the challengeTimeStamp has been correctly set.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the challengeTimeStamp has been set correctly. This is important to ensure that the timestamp of the challenge is accurately recorded.

Scenario 2: Null Timestamp Input Test

Details:
  TestName: testNullTimestampInput
  Description: This test is meant to check how the method handles a null input. In this case, the challengeTimeStamp should not be set and should remain at its initial state.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the challengeTimeStamp to a known initial state.
  Act: Invoke the setChallengeTimeStamp method with null.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the challengeTimeStamp remains at its initial state.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the challengeTimeStamp does not change when a null input is passed. This is important for preventing null pointer exceptions and ensuring data integrity.

Scenario 3: Empty String Input Test

Details:
  TestName: testEmptyStringInput
  Description: This test is meant to check how the method handles an empty string input. In this case, the challengeTimeStamp should not be set and should remain at its initial state.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the challengeTimeStamp to a known initial state.
  Act: Invoke the setChallengeTimeStamp method with an empty string.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the challengeTimeStamp remains at its initial state.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the challengeTimeStamp does not change when an empty string is passed. This is important for preventing invalid data from being set.

Scenario 4: Invalid Timestamp Format Input Test

Details:
  TestName: testInvalidTimestampFormatInput
  Description: This test is meant to check how the method handles an invalid timestamp format input. In this case, the challengeTimeStamp should not be set and should remain at its initial state.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the challengeTimeStamp to a known initial state.
  Act: Invoke the setChallengeTimeStamp method with a string that does not represent a valid timestamp.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the challengeTimeStamp remains at its initial state.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the challengeTimeStamp does not change when an invalid timestamp format is passed. This is important for maintaining data integrity and preventing errors in timestamp processing.
