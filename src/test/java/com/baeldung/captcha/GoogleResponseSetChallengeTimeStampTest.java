================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-359: Exposure of Private Information ('Privacy Violation')
Issue: The setter method setChallengeTimeStamp could potentially expose sensitive data such as timestamps. If misused, this can lead to the disclosure of system information to unauthorized users or systems.
Solution: To resolve this, consider limiting access to this method, implementing proper access control checks and ensuring the least privilege principle.

Vulnerability: CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data
Issue: Jackson, a library that allows conversion between Java objects and JSON, can be used unsafely and lead to remote code execution (RCE).
Solution: To mitigate this, use Jackson's feature 'enableDefaultTyping' wisely, and strictly control the types that are allowed to be deserialized. Consider using more secure alternatives such as using Class Identifier (Class Id) instead of Java class names or use well-known type list.

Vulnerability: CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information
Issue: Sensitive information handled like 'challengeTimeStamp' might be stored in clear text. This could potentially risk the confidentiality of sensitive data.
Solution: To mitigate this, consider using data encryption practices before storing and secure handling of data.

================================================================================
"""
Scenario 1: Test Weekday Timestamp
Details:
    TestName: testWeekdayTimeStamp
    Description: This test validates if the method can accept and set a valid weekday timestamp.
Execution:
    Arrange: A valid weekday timestamp is prepared.
    Act: Invoke setChallengeTimeStamp method with the weekday timestamp.
    Assert: Verify that the 'challengeTimeStamp' field is set to the passed weekday timestamp.
Validation:
    Assert statement verifies the challengeTimeStamp field correctly holds the provided valid weekday timestamp. Proper handling of valid weekday timestamps is crucial to the operation of the application.

Scenario 2: Test Weekend Timestamp
Details:
    TestName: testWeekendTimeStamp
    Description: This test validates if the method can accept and set a valid weekend timestamp.
Execution:
    Arrange: A valid weekend timestamp is arranged.
    Act: Invoke setChallengeTimeStamp method with the weekend timestamp.
    Assert: Assert that 'challengeTimeStamp' field is set to the passed weekend timestamp.
Validation:
    Assert statement verifies if the challengeTimeStamp field correctly holds the provided valid weekend timestamp. The correct handling of valid weekend timestamps is important for the operational efficiency of the application.

Scenario 3: Test Invalid Timestamp
Details:
    TestName: testInvalidTimeStamp
    Description: This scenario verifies if the method appropriately handles invalid timestamps.
Execution:
    Arrange: An invalid timestamp is prepared.
    Act: Invoke setChallengeTimeStamp method with the invalid timestamp.
    Assert: The expected result is to throw an exception or error since the timestamp is not valid.
Validation:
    This scenrio helps validate how the method handles error conditions such as invalid input. Handling invalid timestamps is crucial for preventing runtime errors and maintaining application performance.

Scenario 4: Test Null Timestamp
Details:
    TestName: testNullTimeStamp
    Description: This scenario verifies if the setter method setChallengeTimeStamp can handle null values.
Execution:
    Arrange: Expect a null value.
    Act: Invoke setChallengeTimeStamp method with null.
    Assert: Expect a NullPointerException to be thrown or the default value of the timestamp to be null.
Validation:
    This scenario validates the method's ability to handle null values, which is crucial in avoiding NullPointerExceptions during runtime.

Scenario 5: Test Empty Timestamp
Details:
    TestName: testEmptyTimeStamp
    Description: The aim of this test is to verify whether the method can accept and set an empty string as the timestamp.
Execution:
    Arrange: An empty string is prepared.
    Act: Invoke the setChallengeTimeStamp method with the empty string.
    Assert: Assert that the 'challengeTimeStamp' field is set to the passed empty string.
Validation:
    The assert statement verifies if the challengeTimeStamp field correctly holds an empty string. The ability of the method to handle empty strings is important to avoid application errors.
