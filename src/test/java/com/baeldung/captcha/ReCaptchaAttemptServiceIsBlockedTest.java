================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Unchecked Exception (CWE-248)
Issue: The method 'getUnchecked(key)' might throw an unchecked exception if the key is not found in the cache. Unhandled exceptions can cause the application to crash or expose sensitive debugging information.
Solution: Catch potential exceptions and handle them appropriately. For instance, return a default value when the key is not found.

Vulnerability: Brute Force (CWE-307)
Issue: An attacker can keep trying until 'MAX_ATTEMPT' is met. This can lead to a login enumeration attack.
Solution: Implement a progressive delay in response times or a temporary quarantine of the account/IP after a certain number of failed attempts.

Vulnerability: Lack of Input Validation (CWE-20)
Issue: The key input in 'isBlocked' method does not seem to be validated. This can lead to unexpected behaviour or security vulnerabilities.
Solution: Always validate user input. Check if the input key is null or meets the expected format before processing.

Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References (CWE-639)
Issue: The key might be directly referencing an internal object such as a file or a database record. An attacker can manipulate these references to access unauthorized data.
Solution: Avoid directly using user input to reference internal objects. Implement a mapping between user input and actual object references.

"""
Scenario 1: User Login Attempt is not Blocked 

Details:  
  TestName: testUserLoginAttemptIsNotBlocked
  Description: This test is meant to check if a user login attempt after 1 successful login. It's not supposed to be blocked. 
Execution:
  Arrange: In this test case, we will simulate a single login attempt for a user.
  Act: Then we will call isBlocked method by passing login credentials as a parameter.
  Assert: This test will assert that the return value is false.
Validation: 
  This assertion aims to verify that a single login attempt doesn't lead to a block. The expected result is the normal behavior of the application.

Scenario 2: User Login Attempt is Blocked after Maximum Attempts 

Details:  
  TestName: testUserLoginAttemptIsBlockedAfterMaxAttempt
  Description: This test is meant to check if a user login attempt is blocked after reaching the maximum allowed number of attempts.
Execution:
  Arrange: Simulate a scenario where a user has already made the maximum allowed login attempts.
  Act: Call the method isBlocked by passing the user login credential as a parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the return value is true.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify the maximum attempt limit functionality of the system. The expected result is true as the function should block login after a user exceeds the maximum allowed login attempts.

Scenario 3: User Login Attempt is not Blocked after Maximum Attempts but with Time Interval

Details:  
  TestName: testUserLoginAttemptIsNotBlockedAfterMaxAttemptWithTimeInterval
  Description: This test is meant to check if a user login attempt is not blocked after reaching the maximum attempts but with a grace period in between attempts.
Execution:
  Arrange: Simulate a scenario where a user has already made the maximum allowed login attempts but with a significant amount of idle time in between.
  Act: Call the method isBlocked by passing the same user credential as a parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the return value is false.
Validation: 
  This test is meant to verify that even after a user has exceeded the maximum login attempts, they can still attempt to log in after a specific duration of time.
  
Scenario 4: Null or Invalid User

Details:  
  TestName: testAttemptToLoginWithNullKey
  Description: This test verifies what happens when a null or invalid user attempts to access the system.
Execution:
  Arrange: Pass null as argument to the isBlocked method
  Act: Invoke the target method with the null parameter
  Assert: Use exception handling assertions to handle NullPointerException
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify the function's handling of null or invalid inputs. The test should return a NullPointerException, preventing system crashes due to unhandled exceptions.
