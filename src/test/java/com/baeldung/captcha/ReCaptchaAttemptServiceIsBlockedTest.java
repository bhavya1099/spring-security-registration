ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=isBlocked_759d9b1ac2

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: The function 'isBlocked' returns a boolean value indicating whether a user is blocked or not. While this in itself is not a vulnerability, it could potentially be used for user enumeration if not handled properly.
Solution: It's recommended to return generic error messages to prevent potential information disclosure.

Vulnerability: CWE-307: Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts
Issue: The function 'isBlocked' checks if a user has exceeded the maximum number of attempts. However, it does not appear to implement any lockout mechanism after a certain number of failed attempts.
Solution: Implement a lockout mechanism or progressively delay response times after a certain number of failed attempts to deter brute force attacks.

Vulnerability: CWE-384: Session Fixation
Issue: The 'key' parameter could represent a session identifier. If session identifiers are not properly managed, it could lead to session fixation attacks.
Solution: Ensure that new session identifiers are generated at login and invalidated at logout. Also, consider implementing a timeout for session identifiers.

Vulnerability: CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
Issue: If the 'key' parameter is acquired from an HTTP request without validation, it could be vulnerable to SSRF attacks.
Solution: Validate and sanitize all inputs. If possible, use allow-lists of permitted inputs.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test when attemptsCache contains the key and the value is less than MAX_ATTEMPT

Details:  
  TestName: testIsBlockedWithKeyInCacheAndValueLessThanMaxAttempt.
  Description: This test aims to verify the behavior of the method when the key is present in the attemptsCache and its associated value is less than MAX_ATTEMPT. In this case, the method should return false.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the attemptsCache to return a value less than MAX_ATTEMPT when getUnchecked() is called with the test key.
  Act: Call isBlocked() method with the test key.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value is false.
Validation: 
  The assertion checks if the method correctly identifies that the number of attempts associated with the key is less than the maximum allowed. This is crucial in ensuring the correct application behavior when a key is not blocked.

Scenario 2: Test when attemptsCache contains the key and the value is equal to MAX_ATTEMPT

Details:  
  TestName: testIsBlockedWithKeyInCacheAndValueEqualToMaxAttempt.
  Description: This test is to verify the method's response when the key is present in the attemptsCache and its associated value is equal to MAX_ATTEMPT. The method should return true in this scenario.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the attemptsCache to return a value equal to MAX_ATTEMPT when getUnchecked() is called with the test key.
  Act: Invoke isBlocked() method with the test key.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value is true.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies if the method correctly identifies that the number of attempts associated with the key has reached the maximum allowed. This is important for maintaining the correct application behavior when a key is blocked.

Scenario 3: Test when attemptsCache does not contain the key

Details:  
  TestName: testIsBlockedWithKeyNotInCache.
  Description: This test checks the method's behavior when the key is not present in the attemptsCache. In this case, the method should return false.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the attemptsCache to throw an exception when getUnchecked() is called with the test key.
  Act: Call isBlocked() method with the test key.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value is false.
Validation: 
  The assertion checks if the method correctly handles a situation where the key is not present in the cache. This is essential in ensuring the method's robustness and its ability to handle edge cases.
