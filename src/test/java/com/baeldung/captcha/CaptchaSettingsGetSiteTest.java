================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-276 (Inappropriate Default Permissions)
Issue: If a resource is created with insecure default permissions, it may be accessible by unauthorized actors. This can result in unauthorized information exposure, alteration, or destruction.
Solution: Ensure that resources are created with the least permissive settings possible, potentially restricting the ability of unauthorized actors to misuse them.

Vulnerability: CWE-359 (Exposure of Private Information ('Privacy Violation'))
Issue: If private information about individuals is handled using insecure methods, it may be inadvertently exposed to unauthorized parties. This can result in a breach of users' expectation of privacy, as well as potential legal liabilities.
Solution: Handle private information with adequate care, using secure methods to process, transmit, and store it.

Vulnerability: CWE-502 (Deserialization of Untrusted Data)
Issue: If a program deserializes untrusted data without sufficient validation, an attacker can inject arbitrary code into the serialized payload to modify the program's execution.
Solution: Ensure that deserialized data is appropriately validated. Consider using safe data interchange formats such as JSON or XML, which do not allow a malicious user to place executable code in the data.

  Scenario 1: Test to check if getSite returns the correct site 

  Details:  
    TestName: testGetSiteReturnsCorrectly
    Description: This test is meant to check whether or not the getSite method returns the correct site as per the objectâ€™s value. 

  Execution:
    Arrange: An object where the site value is set.
    Act: Invoke getSite method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result, which is the returned site by getSite, against the expected result using equals method.
  Validation: 
    This aims to verify the proper functioning of getSite. The expected result is the correct site. The significance of this test lies in ensuring that the getSite method is able to return correct site value as given to the object. 


  Scenario 2: Test to check if getSite returns null when a site is not set

  Details:  
    TestName: testGetSiteReturnsNullWhenSiteNotSet
    Description: This test is meant to check if the getSite method returns null when a site is not set to the object.

  Execution:
    Arrange: An object where the site value is not set.
    Act: Invoke getSite method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned value by getSite is null.
  Validation: 
    This test aims to verify that getSite method can handle the scenario when site value is not set and it should return null. This test ensures the system stability when encountering such a case.


  Scenario 3: Test to check if getSite works when a site is set as empty string 

  Details:  
    TestName: testGetSiteWorksWhenSiteIsEmptyString
    Description: This test is meant to check whether getSite method can handle the case when a site value is set as empty string.

  Execution:
    Arrange: An object where the site value is set as an empty string.
    Act: Invoke getSite method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result, which is the returned site by getSite, against the expected result", which is empty string.
  Validation: 
    This test aims to verify that getSite method should not break when a site is set as an empty string and it should return an empty string. This is important to ensure getSite can handle edge cases like this one.
