================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-117: Improper Output Neutralization for Logs
Issue: If logging message includes sensitive data - the value of 'success' in this case - it might end up in log files and other outputs.
Solution: Consider applying proper log sanitization and never log sensitive data.

Vulnerability: CWE-563: Unused Variable
Issue: Unused imports and unused variables can increase the complexity of the code, hide meaningful warning, confuse the developer, and lead to the inclusion of unused libraries that could have potential security implications.
Solution: Remove any unused imports/variables to keep the code clean and less error-prone.

Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: The returned value of isSuccess method might expose sensitive information. Even if 'success' isn't sensitive itself, if it leads to predictable behavior, it might be exploited.
Solution: Always follow principle of least privilege, and expose as less information as possible.

Vulnerability: CVE-2019-12086: jackson-databind
Issue: The imported library, specifically version of jackson-databind before 2.9.9 might allow attackers to have unspecified impact by leveraging failure to block the logback-core class from polymorphic deserialization.
Solution: Keep third party libraries up-to-date and check public databases for known vulnerabilities of used versions. In this case, upgrade jackson-databind to version 2.9.9 or later.

"""
 Scenario 1: Test for Default Success State
  Details:  
    TestName: testDefaultSuccessState.
    Description: This test is designed to check the default state of the success value when no modifications or changes are made. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: No data, mocks or test doubles are required for this test.
    Act: Invoke the isSuccess method without passing any arguments. 
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the returned value is false (as generally, the default boolean value is "false").
  Validation: 
    This test is designed to assert that the object's isSuccess state is defaulting to false when unaltered. It aims to ensure basic functionality.

Scenario 2: Test to Verify Success State is True
  Details:  
    TestName: testSuccessStateIsTrue.
    Description: This test is intended to verify the object's success when it's set to true.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set the success state to true before invoking the method.
    Act: Invoke the isSuccess method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the returned value is true.
  Validation: 
    This test validates that the method returns true when the success state is set to true. This verifies that the setter and getter methods are working correctly.

Scenario 3: Test to Verify Success State is False
  Details:  
    TestName: testSuccessStateIsFalse.
    Description: This test checks the scenario where the success state is set to false.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set the success state to false before invoking the method.
    Act: Invoke the isSuccess method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the value returned is false.
  Validation: 
    This test assesses the condition where the method should return false if the success state is set to false. It verifies if the setter and getter methods are functioning as expected.

Scenario 4: Test the Success State in Multiple Scenarios
  Details:  
    TestName: testSuccessStateInMultipleScenarios.
    Description: This test is designed to assess multiple scenarios for validation, by randomly setting the success state.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Randomly set the success state before invoking the method.
    Act: Invoke the isSuccess method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the value returned matches the previously set success state.
  Validation: 
    This test will verify that the isSuccess method correctly reflects the success state in different scenarios, ensuring the reliability of the method.
