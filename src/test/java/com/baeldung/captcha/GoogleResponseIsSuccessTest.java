================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: The public method 'isSuccess()' could potentially expose sensitive information if the class variable 'success' holds such data.
Solution: Ensure the 'success' variable does not hold sensitive data or restrict the access to this method.

Vulnerability: CWE-1104: Use of Unmaintained Third-Party Libraries
Issue: The code imports third-party libraries, which if not maintained or updated, can have known vulnerabilities that an attacker can exploit.
Solution: Ensure to use the latest version of the libraries and update them frequently. Also, remove unused imports to reduce the attack surface.

"""
  Scenario 1: Test for Success Return Value When It's True

  Details:  
    TestName: testIsSuccessReturnsTrue
    Description: This test is meant to check if the isSuccess method returns true when the success variable is set to true. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set the success variable to true.
    Act: Invoke the isSuccess method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the method returns true.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the method returns the correct value of the success variable. This is significant as it checks the correctness of the method's functionality.

  Scenario 2: Test for Success Return Value When It's False

  Details:  
    TestName: testIsSuccessReturnsFalse
    Description: This test is meant to check if the isSuccess method returns false when the success variable is set to false.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set the success variable to false.
    Act: Invoke the isSuccess method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the method returns false.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the method returns the correct value of the success variable. This is significant as it checks the correctness of the method's functionality.

  Scenario 3: Test for Default Success Value

  Details:  
    TestName: testIsSuccessDefault
    Description: This test is meant to check the default return value of the isSuccess method when the success variable is not explicitly set.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Do not set a value for the success variable.
    Act: Invoke the isSuccess method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the method returns the default value of the success variable (which in Java, for a boolean, is false).
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the method correctly returns the default value when no value has been set. This is significant as it checks the method's behavior in the absence of explicit input.
