================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation
Issue: The code does not appear to perform any certificate validation when making HTTPS requests. This could expose the application to Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks, wherein attackers can intercept and tamper with traffic between the client and the server.
Solution: Add SSL certificate validation logic to ensure that the server is trustworthy. This can often be done using Java's built-in SSL context methods, or by using a trust manager and key manager with a secure random number generator.

Vulnerability: CWE-209: Information Exposure Through an Error Message
Issue: The code may disclose potentially sensitive information via detailed error messages (such as `ReCaptchaUnavailableException`) to the client. Attackers can use this information to tailor their exploits.
Solution: Change your error handling logic so that it does not reveal the specific nature of errors to the client. Instead, use generic error messages and log the specific details server-side where it can be reviewed by administrators but is not accessible to potential attackers.

Vulnerability: CWE-532: Information Exposure Through Log Files
Issue: The LoggerFactory is used, potentially creating verbose logs that can reveal sensitive details, such as the exact operations and responses of the system.
Solution: Limit the data you log, obfuscate or encrypt sensitive data, and secure access to the logs.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Successful ReCaptcha validation response

  Details:  
    TestName: testSuccessfulRecaptchaValidation
    Description: This test is meant to check the successful processing of the ReCaptcha response and ensuring that the application is responding as intended in cases of success.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock a valid ReCaptcha response, action, and associated methods such as getReCaptchaSecret, getClientIP.
    Act: Call the processResponse method with the mock data.
    Assert: Ensure that the reCaptchaAttemptService.reCaptchaSucceeded() method is called.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the application correctly identifies and handles a successful ReCaptcha validation. This is paramount for correct application behavior regarding security checks.

Scenario 2: ReCaptcha validation fails due to incorrect action

  Details:  
    TestName: testRecaptchaValidationFailedDueToIncorrectAction
    Description: This test makes sure that the processResponse method correctly handles the scenario when Google's response returns successful but its action doesn't match the provided action.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock a successful GoogleResponse where googleResponse.getAction() returning different action than provided.
    Act: Call the processResponse method with the mock data.
    Assert: Catch an assertion error confirming that an instance of ReCaptchaInvalidException is thrown.
  Validation: 
    This test is designed to verify that correct exceptions are thrown when the action doesn't match, which correctly represents the application's business logic.

Scenario 3: ReCaptcha validation fails due to low score

  Details:  
    TestName: testRecaptchaValidationFailedDueToLowScore
    Description: This test ensures that when Google's response returns successful but its score is less than the required threshold, a ReCaptchaInvalidException is thrown.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock a successful GoogleResponse where googleResponse.getScore() returns a score lesser than captchaSettings.getThreshold().
    Act: Call the processResponse method with the mock data.
    Assert: An assertion error confirming that an instance of ReCaptchaInvalidException is thrown.
  Validation: 
    This test confirms that the score threshold for ReCaptcha validation is enforced correctly by the application.

Scenario 4: ReCaptcha validation fails due to client error

  Details:  
    TestName: testRecaptchaValidationFailedDueToClientError
    Description: This test validates whether the processResponse method handles correctly when Google's response returns client error.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock a GoogleResponse where googleResponse.hasClientError() returns true.
    Act: Call the processResponse method with the mock data.
    Assert: Assert that a ReCaptchaInvalidException is thrown after reCaptchaAttemptService.reCaptchaFailed() is called.
  Validation: 
    The result of this test verifies the application behavior when client errors occur.

Scenario 5: ReCaptcha service is unavailable 

  Details:  
    TestName: testRecaptchaServiceUnavailable
    Description: This test is designed to simulate a situation where the RestClientException is thrown, indicating that the ReCaptcha service is unavailable.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock a RestClientException from restTemplate.getForObject method call.
    Act: Call the processResponse method with response and action parameters.
    Assert: Assert that a ReCaptchaUnavailableException is thrown.
  Validation: 
    This test asserts that the application appropriately responds to situations where the ReCaptcha service is unavailable, throwing a meaningful exception with a suggestive message.
