================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) or CWE-639
Issue: The key is directly used in the 'reCaptchaFailed' method without any preliminary validation. This can lead to an attacker manipulating the 'key' to influence the application's behavior undesirably.
Solution: Apply Input Validation on 'key'. Utilize java.util.regex or similar libraries to validate input against a safe regular expression. Avoid any keys that dont pass validation.

Vulnerability: Unchecked Exceptions (CWE-248 or CWE-390)
Issue: The 'reCaptchaFailed' method doesn't handle unchecked exceptions. If any runtime error occurs within the 'getUnchecked(key)', the application can break.
Solution: Use a try-catch block to handle possible exceptions during runtime. Consider applying 'Optional' class for better null handling.

Vulnerability: Inadequate Logging & Monitoring (CWE-778)
Issue: There is no logging in this code snippet. An attacker can use this to their advantage, making it harder to detect an attack.
Solution: Implement logging using libraries like Log4j or SLF4J. Log proper error messages, access logs, and use monitoring tools.

================================================================================
"""
  Scenario 1: Test when key is valid and was never used

  Details:  
    TestName: testWhenKeyIsFresh.
    Description: This test scenario checks the increment of the \
    'attempts' for fresh keys, where the key has been used for the first time.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Pass a fresh key with no previous usage.
    Act: Invoke the reCaptchaFailed method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the attempts of the key are incremented to 1.
  Validation: 
    Given a fresh key, the method should increment the attempts to one. This test validates \
    the correct functionality of the reCaptcha failed method when a new key is used.


  Scenario 2: Test when key has previous attempts

  Details:  
    TestName: testWhenKeyHasPreviousAttempts.
    Description: This test scenario validates the increment of the \
    'attempts' for keys that have been used previously.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Pass a key with previous usage.
    Act: Invoke the reCaptchaFailed method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the attempts of the key are incremented properly.
  Validation: 
    The method must increment the attempts by 1 every time a previously used key is passed. This test validates \
    the functionality of the 'reCaptcha failed' method when keys with previous attempts are used.


  Scenario 3: Test for Null key

  Details:  
    TestName: testForNullKey.
    Description: The test scenario is to validate the behavior of the\
    method when a null key is passed.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Pass Null as the key.
    Act: Invoke the reCaptchaFailed method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to expect a NullPointerException.
  Validation: 
    The method should throw a NullPointerException when a Null key is passed. This test scenario validates the error handling of the method.


  Scenario 4: Test when key is an empty string

  Details:  
    TestName: testWhenKeyIsEmptyString.
    Description: This test scenario checks the behavior of the method \
    when the key is an empty string.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Pass an empty string as the key.
    Act: Invoke the reCaptchaFailed method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the attempts of the key are incremented to 1.
  Validation: 
    The method should handle empty strings as keys correctly. Therefore, this test validates the correct functionality when an empty string is used as a key.
