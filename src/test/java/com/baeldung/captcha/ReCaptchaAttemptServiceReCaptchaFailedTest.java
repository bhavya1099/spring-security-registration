================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function
Issue: The method reCaptchaFailed does not perform any authentication checks before incrementing the attempt count for a given key. This could allow an attacker to flood the server with false attempts, potentially causing a denial of service.
Solution: Incorporate appropriate authentication checks before allowing access to critical functionalities. If authentication is not feasible for this function, consider implementing rate limiting to prevent abuse.

Vulnerability: CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling
Issue: There's no limit to the number of attempts that can be made, meaning an attacker could potentially consume large amounts of system resources by continually triggering the reCaptchaFailed function.
Solution: Consider imposing a limit on the number of attempts that can be made within a certain time frame. This could be implemented as part of the existing caching solution, or as a separate rate limiting mechanism.

Vulnerability: CWE-359: Exposure of Private Information ('Privacy Violation')
Issue: The 'key' parameter could potentially expose sensitive information, depending on what it represents. If an attacker can predict or guess valid keys, they may be able to trigger the reCaptchaFailed function for other users.
Solution: Ensure that the 'key' parameter does not expose any sensitive information. If it does, consider using a secure hash or other non-reversible transformation of the sensitive data.

"""
Scenario 1: Testing the increment of attempts on reCaptcha failure
Details:
  TestName: testIncrementOnReCaptchaFailure
  Description: This test is meant to check if the number of attempts increases by one each time a reCaptcha fails. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the CacheLoader to return a predefined number of attempts for a specific key.
  Act: Invoke reCaptchaFailed method with the specific key.
  Assert: Check if the number of attempts for the specific key has increased by one in the attemptsCache.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the reCaptchaFailed method correctly increases the number of attempts in the cache.
  This test is significant as it ensures that the application correctly tracks the number of failed reCaptcha attempts for a specific key.

Scenario 2: Testing the reCaptcha failure with a non-existing key
Details:
  TestName: testReCaptchaFailureWithNonExistingKey
  Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the method when a non-existing key is passed.
Execution:
  Arrange: Ensure that the attemptsCache does not contain the key.
  Act: Invoke reCaptchaFailed method with the non-existing key.
  Assert: Check if the number of attempts for the non-existing key is 1 in the attemptsCache.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the reCaptchaFailed method correctly handles non-existing keys by initializing the number of attempts to 1.
  This test is important as it validates the method's ability to handle edge cases and prevent potential errors or exceptions.

Scenario 3: Testing the reCaptcha failure with null key
Details:
  TestName: testReCaptchaFailureWithNullKey
  Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the method when a null key is passed.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement is required as the key is null.
  Act: Invoke reCaptchaFailed method with a null key.
  Assert: Expect an exception to be thrown.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the method throws an exception when a null key is passed.
  This test is important as it checks the method's robustness and its ability to handle invalid inputs.
