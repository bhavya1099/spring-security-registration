  Scenario 1: Test for Setting a Valid Threshold

  Details:  
    TestName: setValidThreshold.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the setThreshold method updates the 'threshold' variable correctly when a valid float value is passed. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: No need to arrange any data, mocks, or test doubles.
    Act: Invoke the setThreshold method with a valid float value.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the 'threshold' variable has been updated to the passed value.
  Validation: 
    This assertion aims to verify that the 'threshold' variable has been updated correctly. The expected result is the value that was passed to the setThreshold method. This test is significant as it ensures the functionality of updating the 'threshold' variable works as expected.

  Scenario 2: Test for Setting a Negative Threshold

  Details:  
    TestName: setNegativeThreshold.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the setThreshold method handles a negative float value correctly. This is an edge case scenario.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No need to arrange any data, mocks, or test doubles.
    Act: Invoke the setThreshold method with a negative float value.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the 'threshold' variable has been updated to the passed value.
  Validation: 
    This assertion aims to verify that the 'threshold' variable can handle negative values. The expected result is the negative value that was passed to the setThreshold method. This test is significant as it checks the edge case of a negative threshold value.

  Scenario 3: Test for Setting a Zero Threshold

  Details:  
    TestName: setZeroThreshold.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the setThreshold method handles a zero float value correctly. This is an edge case scenario.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No need to arrange any data, mocks, or test doubles.
    Act: Invoke the setThreshold method with a zero float value.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the 'threshold' variable has been updated to the passed value.
  Validation: 
    This assertion aims to verify that the 'threshold' variable can handle zero values. The expected result is the zero value that was passed to the setThreshold method. This test is significant as it checks the edge case of a zero threshold value.
