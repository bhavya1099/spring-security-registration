================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data
Issue: Jackson library can be exploited when deserializing untrusted data, leading to potential Remote Code Execution (RCE) attacks.
Solution: Avoid deserializing untrusted data where possible. Use Jackson's safe type bindings to prevent arbitrary class deserialization. Update Jackson to the latest version to benefit from security patches.

Scenario 1: Test to check if getScore returns the correct score

Details:  
  TestName: testGetScoreReturnsCorrectScore
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getScore method accurately returns the score. 
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as we are only accessing a property.
  Act: Invoke the getScore method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual score against the expected score.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the getScore method is returning the correct score. The expected result is the value that was previously set for the score. This test is significant to ensure that the score is being accurately retrieved.

Scenario 2: Test to check if getScore returns the default score value

Details:  
  TestName: testGetScoreReturnsDefaultScore
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getScore method returns the default score when no score has been set. 
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as we are only accessing a property.
  Act: Invoke the getScore method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual score against the expected default score.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the getScore method is returning the default score when no score has been set. The expected result is the default value of float data type. This test is significant to ensure that the score is being accurately retrieved when no score has been set.

Scenario 3: Test to check if getScore returns the updated score

Details:  
  TestName: testGetScoreReturnsUpdatedScore
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getScore method returns the updated score after the score has been changed. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the score to a new value.
  Act: Invoke the getScore method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual score against the updated score.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the getScore method is returning the updated score. The expected result is the new value that was set for the score. This test is significant to ensure that the score is being accurately retrieved after it has been updated.
