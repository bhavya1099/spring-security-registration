================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Exposed Internal IP address (CWE-200)
Issue: The setHostname method is public and directly sets the value of hostname, this can potentially leak sensitive information such as internal IP addresses to an attacker.
Solution: Consider using a private setter method for the hostname variable and validate the input in a controlled manner. Additionally, avoid exposing sensitive system or network configuration details whenever possible.

Vulnerability: Unrestricted Dependencies (CWE-829)
Issue: There's an unrestricted import statement in the code (import java.util.*;) which can lead to the introduction of unused dependencies in the code leading to potential security vulnerabilities.
Solution: Only explicitly import the classes that are directly used in your code. This will prevent unwanted classes from being loaded and it will be easier to manage the dependencies.

================================================================================
"""
Scenario 1: Null Value for Hostname
Details:
  TestName: setHostnameWithNullValue
  Description: This scenario is designed to test the setHostname method when null value is provided as input. It checks the null assignment to hostname.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class having setHostname method.
  Act: Call the setHostname method with null as the parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if hostname has been assigned null successfully.
Validation: 
  This test is to validate that the method works correctly in the case of null input. This also assists in verifying how the method handles null values as the hostname, helping in uncovering potential null pointer exceptions.

Scenario 2: Empty string for Hostname
Details:
  TestName: setHostnameWithEmptyString
  Description: This scenario is designed to test the setHostname method when empty string is provided as input. It verifies whether hostname can be an empty string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class that owns setHostname method.
  Act: Call the setHostname method with an empty string as the parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to validate if hostname is set to an empty string after method execution.
Validation: 
  This test case validates if hosting an empty string assignment is acceptable. It contributes to understanding if the method implements any checks for non-acceptable string values (like empty strings).

Scenario 3: Valid Hostname Input
Details:
  TestName: setHostnameWithValidInput
  Description: This scenario is designed to test the setHostname method with valid hostname string. It scrutinizes the assignment of valid values to hostname.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class with the setHostname method.
  Act: Call the setHostname method with a valid hostname string.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify if the hostname is appropriately assigned.
Validation: 
  This test confirms the method's core functionality: to correctly assign a valid string input as the hostname. This helps to ensure that the application correctly identifies and refers to the server by its hostname.

Scenario 4: Special Characters in Hostname
Details:
  TestName: setHostnameWithSpecialCharacters
  Description: This test scrutinizes the setHostname method when a string with special characters is provided as input. It checks the assignment of unusual strings with special characters.
Execution:
  Arrange: Generate an instance of the class that holds the setHostname method.
  Act: Invoke the setHostname method with a string that includes special characters.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to validate if the hostname is set to the string containing special characters.
Validation: 
  This test is designed to verify the behavior of the method towards unusual inputs such as special characters and ensure that such inputs are not causing any unexpected application behaviors.
