================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Hardcoded Secret (CWE-798)
Issue: The usage of secrets is mentioned, but it's unclear where the 'secret' variable comes from. If it's hardcoded in the code or stored plainly in properties file, it can be a potential security risk.
Solution: Never hardcode secrets into your code. Use secure ways to store secrets, such as environment variables or secure vault services.

Vulnerability: Insecure Configuration (CWE-16)
Issue: The import of ConfigurationProperties suggests that application properties are being used. If these are not properly secured, it can lead to potential security issues.
Solution: Ensure that all properties files are secured and not included in the public code repository. Use encryption for sensitive data.

Vulnerability: Missing Access Control (CWE-285)
Issue: The getter method for 'secret' is public, which means it can be accessed from anywhere within the application. This can lead to unintentional exposure of sensitive data.
Solution: Limit the accessibility of sensitive data. If this getter method needs to be public, ensure that it's only called from secure contexts.

Scenario 1: Testing GetSecret Method with a Valid Secret

Details:  
TestName: testGetSecretWithValidSecret
Description: This test is meant to check the getSecret method when a valid secret is set. The secret is expected to be returned by the method.
Execution:
Arrange: Set the secret to a known value.
Act: Invoke the getSecret method.
Assert: Assert that the returned secret is the same as the secret you set.
Validation: 
The assertion aims to verify that the getSecret method returns the correct secret. The expected result is the secret that was set, as the getSecret method should return the secret that was set.

Scenario 2: Testing GetSecret Method with No Secret Set

Details:  
TestName: testGetSecretWithNoSecretSet
Description: This test is meant to check the getSecret method when no secret has been set. The method is expected to return null or a default value.
Execution:
Arrange: Do not set the secret.
Act: Invoke the getSecret method.
Assert: Assert that the returned secret is null or the default value.
Validation: 
The assertion aims to verify that the getSecret method returns null or the default value when no secret has been set. The expected result is null or the default value, as the getSecret method should return null or the default value when no secret has been set.

Scenario 3: Testing GetSecret Method with an Empty Secret

Details:  
TestName: testGetSecretWithEmptySecret
Description: This test is meant to check the getSecret method when an empty secret has been set. The method is expected to return an empty string.
Execution:
Arrange: Set the secret to an empty string.
Act: Invoke the getSecret method.
Assert: Assert that the returned secret is an empty string.
Validation: 
The assertion aims to verify that the getSecret method returns an empty string when the secret has been set to an empty string. The expected result is an empty string, as the getSecret method should return the secret that was set, even if it is an empty string.
