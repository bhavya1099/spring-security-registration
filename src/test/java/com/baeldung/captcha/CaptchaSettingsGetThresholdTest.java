================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Dependencies
Issue: Applications often use third-party libraries which may have vulnerabilities that could expose the application to exploits.
Solution: Regularly update dependencies and use automatic vulnerability detection tools or services to get alerts about insecure dependencies.

Vulnerability: CWE-613: Insufficient Session Expiration
Issue: If sessions are not properly expired, an attacker can re-use old session tokens to assume the identity of a user.
Solution: Always expire and invalidate session after a reasonable duration of inactivity or when users logout. Also, refresh tokens periodically.

Vulnerability: CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
Issue: Sensitive information needs to be encrypted during transmission, or else it could be intercepted and exploited by attackers.
Solution: Use HTTPS or any secure protocol for transmitting sensitive information.

Vulnerability: CWE-209: Information Exposure through an Error Message
Issue: Detailed error messages may expose sensitive details of the application, making it easy for attackers to exploit the system.
Solution: Configure your application to show generic error messages to end users and log detailed error messages for the developers' review.

"""
  Scenario 1: Test to check if the getThreshold method returns the correct threshold value
  
  Details:  
    TestName: testReturnCorrectValue.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the getThreshold method is returning the correct threshold value as set in the test. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set a known value for the threshold in your test setup.
    Act: Invoke the getThreshold method.
    Assert: Compare the returned value from getThreshold method to the known value you set in the start.
  Validation: 
    This assertion verifies that the correct threshold value is returned by the getThreshold method. This is important, as any functionality, relying on the threshold will malfunction if an incorrect value is returned.

  Scenario 2: Test to check if the getThreshold method returns a float value
  
  Details:  
    TestName: testReturnFloatValue.
    Description: This test is meant to verify if the return type of getThreshold method is float. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: None required as we're not setting any values.
    Act: Invoke the getThreshold method and store the returned value.
    Assert: Verify the value returned from the getThreshold method is of type float.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies if the returned value from the getThreshold is float. This is crucial because if another type is returned, it might cause class cast exceptions at runtime.

  Scenario 3: Test to check if the getThreshold method returns the default value in the absence of explicit setting
  
  Details:  
    TestName: testDefaultValue.
    Description: This test is meant to check if getThreshold method returns the default value when no value is explicitly set.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Do not set a value for the threshold in your test setup.
    Act: Invoke the getThreshold method.
    Assert: Compare the returned value from getThreshold method to the default value.
  Validation: 
    This assertion verifies that the getThreshold method correctly returns the default value when no value is explicitly set. This test ensures the proper functioning of the application in scenarios where no value is explicitly set.
