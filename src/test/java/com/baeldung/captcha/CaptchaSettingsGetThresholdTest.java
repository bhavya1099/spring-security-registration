================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-117: Improper Output Neutralization for Logs
Issue: Failure to sanitize user-controlled input before it is logged can result in an injection attack.
Solution: Properly sanitize user-controlled inputs before they are logged.

Vulnerability: CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
Issue: If sensitive data is sent over plaintext in a network, an attacker could eavesdrop and steal this data.
Solution: Encrypt sensitive data during transmission over networks.

Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: Information leakage can occur through various means, leading to sensitive information being exposed to unauthorized individuals.
Solution: Ensure that sensitive information is not logged or leaked through debugging information or error messages.

Vulnerability: CWE-307: Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts
Issue: Allowing unlimited authentication attempts can facilitate a brute force attack.
Solution: Introduce a limit on consecutive failed login attempts by the same user or the same IP address.

Vulnerability: CWE-611: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference (XXE)
Issue: If XML input containing a reference to an external entity is processed incorrectly, it can lead to disclosure of internal files.
Solution: Properly configure XML parser and disallow the parsing of external entities.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test to validate if GetThreshold method returns a float 

  Details:  
    TestName: validateGetThresholdReturnType
    Description: This test is intended to verify the returned data type from the GetThreshold method. As per the provided code, the GetThreshold method should return a float.
  Execution:
    Arrange: There isn't any required setup data for this scenario since GetThreshold does not take any parameters.
    Act: Invoke the getThreshold method.
    Assert: Use a JUnit assertion to check if the returned entity is an instance of float.
  Validation: 
    This assertion aims to ensure that only the correct data type - a float is returned by the GetThreshold method. It is important for the accurate interpretation and processing of the threshold value in further execution or operations.

Scenario 2: Test for default Threshold value

  Details:  
    TestName: checkDefaultThreshold
    Description: This test is meant to verify that the getThreshold method returns the correct default value, assuming the default value is already defined in the application.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement is required since the default value is expected from getThreshold without a preceding set operation.
    Act: Invoke the getThreshold method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertion to check that the returned value equals the expected default value.
  Validation: 
    Asserting against a known default value confirms that getThreshold behaves as expected when it has not been set before. 

Scenario 3: Test if the Threshold value is negative

  Details:  
    TestName: validateNegativeThreshold
    Description: This test verifies that the getThreshold method can handle negative values, assuming the threshold can be a negative float in the application context.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set the threshold value to negative.
    Act: Invoke the getThreshold method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertion to verify that the returned value is the same as the set negative value.
  Validation: 
    The successful assertion implies that getThreshold method is capable of handling negative numbers and returns it as it is. The test outcome informs us that our method doesn't limit the range of threshold to only positive numbers, affecting the logic where negative thresholds are allowed.

Scenario 4: Test if the Threshold value is zero

  Details:  
    TestName: validateZeroThreshold
    Description: This test is meant to validate how the getThreshold method handles zero as it could be a meaningful value in certain contexts.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set threshold value to zero.
    Act: Invoke the getThreshold method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assert to verify that the returned value is zero.
  Validation:
    The successful assertion means the getThreshold method handles zero correctly and returns it as expected. This is crucial in the logic where zero threshold holds a significant meaning.
