================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-1104: Use of Unmaintained Third Party Library
Issue: The code is using the 'com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation' library. If this library is not regularly updated, it can lead to software vulnerabilities as attackers can exploit unpatched weaknesses.
Solution: Ensure the used libraries are up-to-date and well maintained. Regularly check for and apply updates or patches to the third-party libraries.

Vulnerability: CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write
Issue: The method 'setErrorCodes' allows setting an array of ErrorCodes. There is the potential for an out-of-bounds write if not validated correctly, which could lead to a system crash or other unforeseen consequences.
Solution: Ensure the handling code validates the size and boundaries of data in arrays. Consider using Collections instead of raw arrays for better control and ease in handling.

Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: As the setErrorCodes method accepts an array of error codes, there is a possibility of input not being validated. This can lead to unexpected behavior or potential security vulnerabilities if not managed correctly.
Solution: Implement proper input validation policies with sanity checks on any user-supplied inputs. You should also verify whether the error codes provided are within the acceptable range and handle exceptions gracefully.

================================================================================
"""
Scenario 1: Test when a valid ErrorCode array is passed to the method

Details: 
  TestName: setErrorCodesWithValidArray
  Description: This test is meant to validate when a correct and valid ErrorCode[] array is passed as a parameter to the setErrorCodes method, it should proceed without throwing any exceptions and set this array as the errorCodes attribute.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a valid ErrorCode array.
  Act: Invoke setErrorCodes method passing the valid array.
  Assert: Check if the errorCodes attribute is now equal to the provided array. 
Validation:
  This aims to verify that the method can correctly handle valid input and behaves as expected when a proper ErrorCode array is passed to it. If this passes, we can be confident that our setErrorCodes method works fine with valid inputs.

Scenario 2: Test when a null array parameter is passed to the method

Details: 
  TestName: setErrorCodesWithNullArray
  Description: This scenario is to test how the method behaves when a null ErrorCode[] array is passed as a parameter. It should properly set the errorCodes attribute as null without causing any exceptions.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement required as we are passing null to the method.
  Act: Invoke setErrorCodes method passing null.
  Assert: Assert that the errorCodes attribute is indeed null.
Validation:
  This is to ensure that our method can safely handle null inputs as this is a valid real-world scenario. This also checks if the method correctly sets the errorCodes attribute as null.

Scenario 3: Test when an empty ErrorCode array is passed to the method

Details: 
  TestName: setErrorCodesWithEmptyArray
  Description: This scenario tests the methodâ€™s behavior when an empty ErrorCode[] array is passed as a parameter. The method should not throw any exceptions and should set errorCodes attribute as the empty array.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an empty ErrorCode[] array.
  Act: Invoke setErrorCodes method passing the empty array.
  Assert: Verify that the errorCodes attribute is an empty array.
Validation:
  This test validates that the method can handle being passed empty arrays as parameters. This is crucial as it's a perfectly valid scenario and the method should be able to set the attribute correctly in this case.
