================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Input Validation (CWE-20)
Issue: Java applications that do not validate input can be vulnerable to injection attacks, amongst other issues.
Solution: Implement strong input validation for all data received from the user or from external systems.

Vulnerability: Inadequate Logging & Monitoring (CWE-778)
Issue: Insufficient logging and monitoring can make it difficult to detect malicious activity and understand when and how a breach has occurred.
Solution: Ensure that all security-relevant actions are logged and that there are mechanisms in place to alert administrators to suspicious activity.

Vulnerability: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data (CWE-311)
Issue: Storing sensitive data without encryption leaves it vulnerable to theft and interception.
Solution: Ensure that sensitive data is securely encrypted both at rest and in transit using Industry standard encryption algorithms and techniques.

Vulnerability: Use of Hard-coded Credentials (CWE-798)
Issue: Including hardcoded credentials in the application makes it possible for an attacker to discover them and gain unauthorized access.
Solution: Remove hardcoded credentials; consider using secure storage solutions, like vaults or environment variables, instead.

Vulnerability: Use of Insufficiently Random Values (CWE-330)
Issue: Use of predictable or insufficiently random values in security-sensitive context could lead to predictability in session identifiers, CSRF tokens etc.
Solution: Leverage secure random number generators offered by Java.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test with valid ErrorCode array
Details:  
  TestName: setErrorCodesWithValidData
  Description: This test will check whether the method correctly set the 'errorCodes' field with a valid ErrorCode array. 
Execution:
  Arrange: An instance of the class and an ErrorCode array with valid codes. 
  Act: Invoke the setErrorCodes method with the ErrorCode array. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertion to verify the 'errorCodes' field was updated with the given array.
Validation: 
  This test confirms if the setErrorCodes method successfully sets the 'errorCodes' field. If it fails, it suggests there may be a problem with assigning an array to the field.

Scenario 2: Test with an empty ErrorCode array
Details:  
  TestName: setErrorCodesWithEmptyArray
  Description: This test evaluates the method's behavior when it receives an empty ErrorCode array. 
Execution:
  Arrange: An instance of the class and an empty ErrorCode array. 
  Act: Invoke the setErrorCodes method with the empty array. 
  Assert: Assert if the 'errorCodes' field was cleared or is empty post the method execution.
Validation: 
  This checks if an empty ErrorCode array can be applied successfully. An error might hint at the method's required validation or significant error handling mechanisms for handling empty data.

Scenario 3: Test with a null argument
Details:  
  TestName: setErrorCodesWithNullArgument
  Description: Validate if the method can handle null input without crashing or propagating errors.
Execution:
  Arrange: An instance of the class.
  Act: Invoke the setErrorCodes method with an argument as null. 
  Assert: Assert if no exception is thrown, and the 'errorCodes' field does not contain any data.
Validation: 
  It's vital that the method handles null inputs gracefully. If a NullPointer Exception or a similar error is thrown, it indicates an unintended code path.
  
Scenario 4: Test with large ErrorCode array
Details:  
  TestName: setErrorCodesWithLargeArray.
  Description: This test will check if the method can handle a large amount of data without crashing or slowing down dramatically.
Execution:
  Arrange: An instance of the class and a large ErrorCode array.
  Act: Invoke setErrorCodes with the large ErrorCode array.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertion to see if the 'errorCodes' field was updated with the large array without any issues. 
Validation: 
  This test checks for scalability issues in the setErrorCodes method. Failing might mean the method is inefficient with large data sets.
