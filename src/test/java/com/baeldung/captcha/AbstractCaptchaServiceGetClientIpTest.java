================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-117: Improper Output Neutralization for Logs
Issue: In the event of an attack, an attacker can introduce malicious inputs that, when logged, can potentially corrupt the log file or mislead log readers by disguising malicious behavior as benign, or by obscuring legitimately malicious activity.
Solution: Ensure user input is properly sanitized before being logged. Apply context-appropriate output escaping libraries (like OWASP Java Encoder) before logging data to ensure special characters do not carry an unintended meaning in the log viewing software.

Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: Direct exposure of potentially sensitive information such as a client IP address can potentially enable illegitimate tracking, identity theft, and other improper uses of the info. If unauthorized individuals gain access to the logs containing these details, they can utilize this info for malicious purposes.
Solution: Avoid logging private data where possible. When mandatory, ensure logs are protected with adequate access controls to prevent unauthorized access.

Vulnerability: CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)
Issue: Direct use of user-supplied input in output operations can potentially lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities if the user-supplied data include malicious scripting.
Solution: Always sanitize and validate user-supplied data, using methods such as output encoding, input validation, or others, depending upon the specific case and context.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test getClientIP with no "X-Forwarded-For" header

Details:
  TestName: testGetClientIPWithNoXForwardedForHeader
  Description: This test will validate if the method can accurately retrieve the IP address from request header when the "X-Forwarded-For" header is not present. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a mock HttpServletRequest having no header with the name "X-Forwarded-For". 
  Act: Invoke the getClientIP method.
  Assert: Assert that the method should return the remote IP address present in the request.
Validation: 
  This assertion verifies that the fallback IP retrieval is correctly implemented. The method should return the remote IP address whenever "X-Forwarded-For" header is not present.


Scenario 2: Test getClientIP with empty "X-Forwarded-For" header 

Details:
  TestName: testGetClientIPWithEmptyXForwardedForHeader
  Description: This test will check if the method can deal with an empty "X-Forwarded-For" header.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a mock HttpServletRequest with an empty "X-Forwarded-For" header. 
  Act: Invoke the getClientIP method.
  Assert: Assert that the method should return the remote IP address present in the request.
Validation: 
  This scenario checks the method's behavior when dealing with an empty header. It should ignore the header and use the remote address instead.


Scenario 3: Test getClientIP with "X-Forwarded-For" header not containing remote address

Details:
  TestName: testGetClientIPWithNotMatchingXFFFHeader
  Description: This test will validate the method's behavior when the "X-Forwarded-For" header is not containing the remote address.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a mock HttpServletRequest with "X-Forwarded-For" header which does not contain request's remote address.
  Act: Invoke the getClientIP method.
  Assert: Assert that the method should return the remote IP address present in the request.
Validation: 
  This test checks the method's handling of headers that do not contain the remote IP address. It should resort to returning the remote address instead.


Scenario 4: Test getClientIP with valid "X-Forwarded-For" header

Details:
  TestName: testGetClientIPWithValidXForwardedForHeader
  Description: This test will check the method's proper functioning when it is given a correct "X-Forwarded-For" header.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a mock HttpServletRequest with a valid "X-Forwarded-For" header containing a list of IP addresses including the remote IP.
  Act: Invoke the getClientIP method.
  Assert: Assert that the method returns the first IP address from the "X-Forwarded-For" header.
Validation: 
  This scenario validates the correct processing of the "X-Forwarded-For" header by this method. In normal situations, the method should return the first IP from the header.
