================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: The 'setSiteV3' method in the com.baeldung.captcha package is public and can potentially reveal sensitive information about the website's structure. If malicious users gain access to such methods, they can read or modify the site key, which can lead to serious security issues like unauthorized actions.
Solution: Make 'setSiteV3' method private or package-private if no external classes require it and check the method usage thoroughly. Always be conscious of what level of access your methods require.

Vulnerability: CWE-749: Exposed Dangerous Method or Function
Issue: The 'setSiteV3' function modifies a class-level variable. Exposing such methods publicly can allow unauthorized changes to important variables by third-party users or code.
Solution: Restrict the method access modifier to the lowest possible level (e.g., private or package-private). If public access is absolutely necessary, ensure the method implementation includes sufficient security checks like data validation and verification.

Vulnerability: CWE-598: Information Exposure Through Query Strings in GET Request
Issue: If siteV3 is an information that forms part of a GET request, it can expose sensitive information as it may be logged in various places like browser history, logs, etc.
Solution: Sensitive information should not be sent as part of the URL in a GET request. Use POST or other methods that include the information as part of the body.

"""
  Scenario 1: Positive Test - Test to check if the variable siteV3 is being set correctly.

  Details:  
    TestName: setSiteV3ToValidValue.
    Description: This test is designed to validate the setter method. Specifically, it will test if the string value is being correctly set to the variable siteV3.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a valid string value.
    Act: Call the setSiteV3 method with the created value.
    Assert: Assert that the siteV3 variable is now equal to the value that was set.
  Validation: 
    The test validates that the setter method correctly sets the value of the variable "siteV3". Correct functionality of this method ensures that the fields in an object can be adequately manipulated.

  Scenario 2: Negative Test - Attempting to set the variable siteV3 to null.

  Details:  
    TestName: setSiteV3ToNull.
    Description: This test checks the behavior of the setSiteV3 method when a null value is passed as a parameter.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a null string value.
    Act: Call the setSiteV3 method with the null value.
    Assert: Assert that the siteV3 variable is now null.
  Validation: 
    The test verifies that the setter method can handle null inputs. The result is expected to be null which will allow developing a correct error handling strategy.
   
  Scenario 3: Negative Test - Verifying the behavior of the setter when trying to set an empty string.

  Details:  
    TestName: setSiteV3ToEmptyString.
    Description: This test is designed to verify the behavior of the setSiteV3 method when an empty string is passed as a parameter.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an empty string value.
    Act: Call the setSiteV3 method with the empty string.
    Assert: Assert that the value of the siteV3 variable is now an empty string.
  Validation: 
    This test serves to validate that the setter method handles empty strings appropriately. The expected result is an empty string, and this test ensures that the software handles potentially empty inputs.
