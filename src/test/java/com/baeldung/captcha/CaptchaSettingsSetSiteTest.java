================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Missing Input Validation (CWE-20)
Issue: The setSite method does not perform any form of input validation which could lead to security vulnerabilities if the input is later used or processed in an unsafe manner. This is commonly exploited in Injection Attacks or Cross Site Scripting(XSS) which could potentially compromise the security of the system.
Solution: Implement strict input validation on all parameters and reject any that do not adhere to these constraints. Consider using regular expressions to limit the range of valid inputs. Additionally, always encode data that will be output to ensure it's safe to display.

Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References (CWE-639)
Issue: The setSite method appears to change an internal state of the object without performing authorization checks. This could be exploited by an attacker to alter the state of object to unauthorized values.
Solution: Always perform authorization checks before changing an internal state or calling any methods that modify the object to prevent an attacker from changing internal state to an arbitrary value. Need to ensure that proper Access Control mechanisms are set in place.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test to check the successful set of valid site

Details:  
  TestName: testSetValidSite.
  Description: This scenario is meant to test whether the method successfully sets a valid site string to the class property.
Execution:
  Arrange: A string value representative of a valid site.
  Act: Invoke the setSite method with valid site string. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check whether the class property site has been successfully set to the passed value.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify whether the setSite method is functioning as intended when provided with a valid input string. This test is significant in ensuring that the application can accurately set and store a site string.

Scenario 2: Test to check if empty string is accepted 

Details:  
  TestName: testSetEmptySite.
  Description: This scenario is meant to test whether the method sets an empty string to the site property. 
Execution:
  Arrange: An empty string.
  Act: Invoke the setSite method with the empty string. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check whether the class property 'site' becomes an empty string after the method call.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify the behavior of the method when it is provided an empty string as input. The test's purpose is to ensure that the application correctly handles scenarios in which the site string provided is empty.

Scenario 3: Test to check if null input is handled

Details:  
  TestName: testSetNullSite.
  Description: This scenario is meant to test whether the method can handle null input without throwing an exception. 
Execution:
  Arrange: A null string.
  Act: Invoke the setSite method with the null string.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check whether the setSite method does not throw a NullPointerException.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify the behavior of the method when null is passed as input. This test is important in ensuring that the application gracefully handles null inputs without causing unexpected exceptions.
