================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
Issue: The method `reCaptchaSucceeded` directly invalidates cache by the key without any sort of input validation. This can lead to unauthorized access or manipulation of other users' captcha cache by simply passing their keys.
Solution: Instead of directly using the keys passed in the methods, ensure they are properly sanitized or validated. Moreover, instead of relying on direct references alone, consider the usage of safe indirect references to instances.

Vulnerability: CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption
Issue: The `CacheBuilder` from `com.google.common.cache` is used without limiting the amount of data that can be stored. If not controlled, this could lead to excessive memory usage, causing OutOfMemoryError or degrade the performance of the application.
Solution: Apply constraints on the maximum size or weight of the cache when building the cache instance using `CacheBuilder` methods like `maximumSize` or `maximumWeight`.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Key Validation Test  
 
Details:  
    TestName: validateKeyInReCaptchaSucceeded.
    Description: Check if the correct key is used while calling reCaptchaSucceeded method and it gets invalidated correctly without any errors. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the behavior of attemptsCache and arrange a valid key.
    Act: Invoke reCaptchaSucceeded method with the established valid key.
    Assert: Assert that the key provided to the method is invalidated from the attemptsCache.
  Validation: 
    Verify that the key tried to access the Cache was invalidated. Proves the method reCaptchaSucceeded performs the key invalidation correctly.

Scenario 2: Key Invalid Test  

Details:  
    TestName: testInvalidKeyInReCaptchaSucceeded.
    Description: This test is used to check whether the system handles the scenario of getting an invalid or non-existent key.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the behavior of attemptsCache and arrange for an invalid key.
    Act: Invoke reCaptchaSucceeded method with the invalid key.
    Assert: The invalid key passed should not affect anything within attemptsCache.
  Validation: 
    Verify that the 0 impact on the Cache when the method is called with an invalid key. This validates how the system handles errors or invalid inputs.

Scenario 3: Null Key Test  

Details:  
    TestName: testNullKeyInReCaptchaSucceeded.
    Description: This test is used to check how the system handles a scenario when a null key is passed.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the behavior of attemptsCache and arrange a null key.
    Act: Invoke reCaptchaSucceeded method with null key.
    Assert: Assert that attemptsCache was not affected by the null key.
  Validation: 
    Verify that the Cache is not impacted when the method is called with a Null key. It ensures the system's ability to handle null inputs and prevent potential failures or exceptions.
    
Scenario 4: Empty Key Test  

Details:  
    TestName: testEmptyKeyInReCaptchaSucceeded.
    Description: This test is used to verify whether the system can handle the scenario of an empty key.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the behavior of attemptsCache and establish an empty key.
    Act: Invoke reCaptchaSucceeded method with the empty key.
    Assert: Assert that the Cache remains unaffected by the empty key.
  Validation: 
     Verify that the Cache is not influenced when the method is called with an empty key. It checks the system's ability to handle empty inputs and prevent potential system failures or exceptions.
