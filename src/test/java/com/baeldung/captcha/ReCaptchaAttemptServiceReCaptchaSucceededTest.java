================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: The 'reCaptchaSucceeded' method might be revealing too much information about the underlying system. If the 'key' parameter is sensitive, invalidating it could leak information.
Solution: Ensure that keys do not contain sensitive information. Limit the amount of information that can be inferred from the key.

Vulnerability: CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function
Issue: The 'reCaptchaSucceeded' method does not seem to have any authentication mechanism in place. This could potentially allow unauthorized access to the function.
Solution: Implement an authentication mechanism before allowing access to the function.

Vulnerability: CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling
Issue: The 'attemptsCache' could potentially be filled without limit, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) situation.
Solution: Implement a limit to the number of entries 'attemptsCache' can hold. Consider using a Least Recently Used (LRU) Cache.

"""
Scenario 1: Test to validate if the method successfully invalidates the cache for a given key

Details:  
  TestName: testReCaptchaSucceededWithValidKey
  Description: This test is designed to verify if the reCaptchaSucceeded method correctly invalidates the cache for the given key. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mocked version of the attemptsCache and set it to contain a specific key.
  Act: Invoke the reCaptchaSucceeded method with the specific key.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the key is removed from the cache.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify if the key is successfully invalidated from the cache. The expected result is that the key should not exist in the cache after the method execution. This test is significant as it validates the basic functionality of the reCaptchaSucceeded method.

Scenario 2: Test to validate the method behavior with a non-existing key 

Details:  
  TestName: testReCaptchaSucceededWithNonExistingKey
  Description: This test is designed to verify the behavior of the reCaptchaSucceeded method when a non-existing key is provided. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mocked version of the attemptsCache without the specific key.
  Act: Invoke the reCaptchaSucceeded method with the non-existing key.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the method execution completes without any exceptions.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify if the method handles non-existing keys gracefully. The expected result is that the method should complete execution without any exceptions. This test is significant as it checks the robustness of the reCaptchaSucceeded method.

Scenario 3: Test to validate method behavior with a null key

Details:  
  TestName: testReCaptchaSucceededWithNullKey
  Description: This test is designed to verify the behavior of the reCaptchaSucceeded method when a null key is provided. 
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific arrangement needed as the key to be passed is null.
  Act: Invoke the reCaptchaSucceeded method with a null key.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if an appropriate exception is thrown.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify if the method is capable of handling null keys. The expected result is that an appropriate exception should be thrown. This test is significant as it checks the error handling capability of the reCaptchaSucceeded method.
